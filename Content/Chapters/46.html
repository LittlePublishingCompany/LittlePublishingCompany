<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I must have been in the sewer longer than I thought for the sun was beginning to fade into the horizon. The cold hasn&rsquo;t let up, in fact maybe it had gotten colder. The snow hadn&rsquo;t stopped falling either. It was actually frozen rain and hurt when it hit my face. I didn&rsquo;t want to go back down to the school and there was no one else that would help me, so I was going to have to stick it out here for the rest of the day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decide sticking to the roofs will be my best bet for survival. The building next to me has lots holes in it, and wouldn&rsquo;t you know, but they&rsquo;re just in the right places to climb up.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a matter of seconds, I find myself on top of the shabby roof where shingles are missing in too many places. The wind hits me hard up here and the rain seems a little sharper than before. I have to walk carefully as ice has formed in unseen patches all over this roof.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I start moving, staying to the side furthest away from the street, but I can hear commotion coming, so I stay low, keeping out of sight but my ears open. It sounds like marching.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I jump to a roof with a gaping hole in it and barely avoid the hole. My eyes catch movement from here and I look down into the hole to see a huddled family gathered together.&nbsp; There is a mom, a dad, and two sons. They look terrified in their destroyed home. I hold my index finger to my lips and signal them to remain quiet and stay where they are. Then I lay down a little beside the hole after undoing my rifle from my shoulder. I am in a spot where I cannot be seen, and using the rifle&rsquo;s scope, I survey the scene below.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nazi&rsquo;s are moving in larger numbers than usual in tightly formed squads. A squad breaks off from the main group. Potato mashers are in their hands. I turn my scope to the house they are in front of. There are several families on the inside and I can see them wildly moving about, but they are not leaving. The Nazi&rsquo;s twist the potato mashers and chunk them through the windows, shattering the glass. There is silence for a few moments and then a explosion throughout the neighborhood. My ears ring. I continue to watch as the families try to get out.&nbsp; Some leap from the three story windows, smashing on the ground and breaking bones, trying to crawl away as the Nazi&rsquo;s shoot them dead. Others run from the house on fire and with limbs missing and chunks out of their skin. They cry out in agony as they too are shot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see another squad break away near to the school. God, I wish I had more than eight bullets. Staring into the abyss, I think it would take a simple trigger pull to take at least someone down so that I could say I wasn&rsquo;t just a waste. My brain screams that I have the means to do something about it, but the flesh is weak and I don&rsquo;t think I can afford my own life for the cost of all. I keep them in my sights; I even draw down on them, because it makes me feel better for not shooting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can hear the kids crying now below in the hole beneath me. Their sound leaves a sinking feeling in my gut. If the kids don&rsquo;t shut up, we&rsquo;re all gonna be in a world of hurt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then, a scream shatters the air. The darkening sky throws things in blurrier ways. I see a bottle on fire fly from the School&rsquo;s manhole. It shatters in the midst of soldiers, and they run screaming, throwing themselves to the ground, extinguishing themselves in the snow. I see Polish men running towards them, but they are quickly shot down. Brief moments leave ruin, but the ticks of the clock don&rsquo;t matter when you&rsquo;re fighting with attrition. I don&rsquo;t carry a clock anymore. Time does not exist in the garden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t hear anything coming from the school. One of the boys is still crying below, and the soldiers move in our direction. I hear the door crash in and the sounds of the heavy footsteps up the stairs. Screams come from the hole. I am breathless as a flutter of both German and Polish words babble in the air. Then shots burst, and the family is silent. A German commander barks orders and the footsteps pound back down the stairs and out onto the streets.&nbsp; More shouts as they throw fire into the house.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>God, God, God!</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to rear up and throw myself off these icy shingles and lay by <em>her</em> grave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to stay until they leave. Death by bullet or burning, not much of an option. The soldiers stay until the moon is high and their marches bramble off into the cold night. I sneeze loudly. It tastes like I&rsquo;m getting a cold. Ice has formed on the tips of my wings, and I can&rsquo;t stop shivering. Moving is unbearable, but I have to because the flames are licking near and I see their glow from the hole below. I crawl across the ice-covered roof. I can&rsquo;t stand when I get to the edge. <em>It&rsquo;s only two stories down. I&rsquo;ll survive.</em> I let myself fall off. Frostbite makes it all the more painful. I would swear something has shattered off. I almost cry out, but I stifle it and pass out.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wake with a shudder in my stomach. A patch of snow has formed over me. I find I have some mobility, probably from the fire still burning from the house. It&rsquo;s almost ashes now. I stand up and shake the snow from me; vertigo hits, and I almost fall back down. But I steady myself.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an eerie silence in the night air. I walk to the edge of the house on my left, one of the few left standing. I drag myself to the edge and peek across the way, looking for signs of life, but find none, just bodies and scabs. An awful mess, I confess. I confess.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hug the sides of the house and drag my limp frame with the rifle still flung across my shoulder, making my way to the school, hoping for the best, expecting the worst. The snow is burning my feet as I realize the fire has melted my soles away.&nbsp; Frostbite will most likely kill me.&nbsp; Maybe tonight, if I get it right.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I round the corner to the alleyway that is stuck between two houses on their sides. Bodies scattered everywhere. Some I recognize; Motti at the head of them out in the middle of the street, his face smashed in. Bolek is near the entrance to the school, his body leans against the side of a house, his body riddled with bullets. His eyes are wide open and staring. They speak something I do not want to hear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see the cover to the School missing and dread fills me. I stop for a minute watching the area. All is still but I hear a faint sound and see movement, white movement. I am shaking in fear as I whip my rifle around to face whoever it might be. I see nothing at first, only white lines moving, it is nothing until the moonlight hits its eyes and I see that it is the white cat, unharmed, meowing in the cold night air. It stares at me much like Bolek&rsquo;s dead eyes do. The sight of it rattles me. I make my way to the manhole.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look down into its depths, its awful depths, and see nothing. I begin to climb down, while the cat watches, meowing once more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the bottom, I find Sheol.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodies everywhere, the children and Mrs. Przyszlasz lie in a row as if on purpose. I race around checking the bodies, not a one of them has a bullet in them. I find no signs of what ended them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move slowly from the room to the bigger chamber where we had just eaten earlier that day. It is empty, except for little Izolda&rsquo;s body sitting at the table, all alone with her head lying down. She is sitting in a chair much too big for her. I lift her head and look at her blank expression. I still see it when I close my eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face suggests something easy; something painless.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table to her left is an open tin, the one that held the chocolate, except where there were twenty pieces there were now only a few. I drag the tin close to me and look at the sweets.&nbsp; I pick one up and smell it and I finally understand. Motti decided it was now time to eat them. I throw them across the room. Little Izolda was always Adrianna&rsquo;s favorite.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I cross the bodies carefully and climb back up the ladder, my feet freezing on the frozen metal. My tears want to come out, but to do would be dangerous. To the top, I find myself in the snow and the cat is still there waiting patiently.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk over to the body against the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I close Bolek&rsquo;s eyes and take his shoes, the cat follows me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know the answer now to Adrianna&rsquo;s question.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was never blue to begin with, it was always green and she never bats an eye. No, she never batted an eye.&nbsp;</span></span>
