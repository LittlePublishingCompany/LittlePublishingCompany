<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I&rsquo;m convinced there is a story to be told. And frankly, the events of the last couple of days resemble, in my mind at least, the sort of dark times in which such a story becomes quite pressing. It needs to be told right now.<br />
<br />
But I&rsquo;m not all certain this story is mine. Only mine, that is. I&rsquo;ve thought for a long time that the whole world is looking to be a part of a story. I say that because I want to be a part of a story. Consider that school students are required to take history every year through their primary education. The histories change; one school year students may study the story of the world dressed up under the title of world history. Another year may find students studying American history, a particularly prized story that heralds poor military heroes while simultaneously hiding massive injustices. Some students will study the history of their state. Either way, school boards and the ambiguous &ldquo;they&rdquo; of academia seem completely committed to young boys and girls learning the repertoire of stories that define them as a person.<br />
<br />
But history is not the only type of story I&rsquo;ve noticed. Some craft a narrative of what it would look like for them to be successful, or for their kids to be successful. There are stories that are completely absurd in their detail and account, such as a hare racing a turtle, whose sole purpose is to convey some moral or ridiculous life lesson. Regardless of the context, pretext, or purpose, these stories unknowingly define every decision one might make from where to go to college, who to marry, what career to pursue or whether or not to kill themselves. To say &ldquo;story&rdquo; is to identify a force that moves and shakes every corner of life.<br />
<br />
The assumption these stories, or collection of stories that make up a larger story called &ldquo;history&rdquo; proves, at least in my mind, people want to be a part of a grand tale of adventure and excitement. For that matter, why are novels so popular? Why do people rave about television shows? For no other reason than the thought-provoking and surprising plot of the show! It seems that people get wrapped up in stories because it makes them feel alive, at least for a brief moment. They feel like they&rsquo;re someone. Someone important. Or, if they don&rsquo;t feel like someone, they get to imagine what it would be like to be someone. These stories enliven people; they help them know life is worth the living. Stories are powerful things.<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m wrapped up in my own story. If stories have the ability to make individuals feel alive, feel important, feel needed, I suppose the negative is true as well. It only makes sense stories have the ability to destroy an individual&rsquo;s capacity to be a person. A story could destroy their life. The right story, or the wrong one I suppose, is able to unmake some poor soul. A story could make them feel forgotten, unneeded, and abandoned. Like I said, I&rsquo;m on suicide watch. And my story has wrapped me up in a tangle of despair. Perhaps, this helps explain the tension that occupies the soul of one confused 21‐year‐old. Perhaps.<br />

I think of a time in 5th grade. My teacher had divided us into groups of three and had taken us out to the park attached to the school. It was a listening and teamwork exercise. One member of the group was supposed to tell the second member of the group to go and complete some task. This person was to do exactly as the other said. The third member of the group would then help the second member complete the task assigned by the first person of the group to the second.<br />
<br />
As soon as the exercise was over, my teacher immediately came over to our group to scold me. She&rsquo;d been watching. The two other members of my team were the incredibly assertive type; the type that everyone knew would be &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; when they were older, whatever that meant. They were the type that exuded not only an air of confidence, but also of arrogance. Students like this confused me. How was it that they had found such a solid ground to stand upon as eleven‐year‐olds? How were they so confident? It was as like they already knew themselves better than I could ever hope to know myself many years later.<br />
<br />
Such confidence seemed completely foreign to me. I hadn&rsquo;t performed my analysis of the beginnings of my own narrative &ndash; my parents, their love in whatever form it took. Imagine attempting to figure out a story, be confident in where the story was heading, if you didn&rsquo;t know the beginning. I suppose some stories permit that sort of reading; most do not. Such was my life, epitomized in this one moment. I had been charged to help my classmates, completely oblivious to myself as a person. Already bound to the secondary role of helper, I failed. It seemed small ineptitudes such as this would dominate my life, a life of searching for place, for a role in the dance, a play in the game. These scenes formed the episodes, and eventually the chapters of my life, culminating in, or at least it felt like a culmination at the time, a swinging pendulum.<br />
<br />
Oftentimes, I wish there were a way to insert myself into the story of another person. From the outset, the stories of others seem so much more attractive. They make the featured table at the bookstore. What if I could make a grand trade? What if I could swap the lead for an extra? If it meant being in a different story altogether, being a nameless individual in the scene of another&rsquo;s narrative, life would be nice. Life would be simple. It would be contained in the simple twenty pace path from one storefront to the next, over and over. Monotony could be beautiful, right?<br />
<br />
As much as I&rsquo;d like to change stories, swap roles, and leave this whole mess behind, I&rsquo;m too engulfed in my own story. Perhaps, my story is too wrapped up in me. One way or the other, there&rsquo;s no escaping yourself. And attempting to leave your own story behind is nothing more than trying to escape yourself&mdash;remove your own shadow. Not even Death himself could separate me from my story. So the question remains, what is my story? What is this force I&rsquo;ve become so enraptured by, pursuing a more survivable tale as a replacement for the unhappiness that seems so prevalent in my own story? Is this account merely a list of details in history? Is it the minutes of a meeting that goes on and on for about 75 years and then is adjourned in some anticlimactic way? What is it?<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ve decided this writing experiment must undoubtedly be part of the story as much as it is a telling of it. After all, I can&rsquo;t escape the story. And even on my worst days, the days when I&rsquo;m convinced I really want out, I wouldn&rsquo;t really trade my story for another. As I said, that would mean ceasing to be me.</span></span>
