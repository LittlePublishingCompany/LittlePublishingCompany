<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The library was quiet this time of day so that was where I went to write. I suppose it was a good thing my parents named me after a famous poet, maybe even ironic. I used it and lived by it. Somewhere I think Rainer would be proud.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was looking forward to going to my spot, for it had been a long day of Saturday school. Writing of any kind was an escape from such nonsense, but poetry, I think, was my favorite. It allowed me to say things, sometimes without ever saying them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poetry digressed through my mind as I ascended the seemingly infinite stairs of the college library. Poetry was like a puzzle that formed a grander picture, but it was up to me to figure out where and how the pieces fit. This was what was on my mind most of the time, if I am being honest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finished the stairs, I saw a person in <em>my area</em> where I wrote <em>alone</em>. I did not know this person, this female, who sat now there. C&rsquo;mon, it was a Saturday night after all, who came to the school library on a Saturday night&mdash;I mean, other than me? I was angry at the predicament, at least until I examined the girl a little more closely.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean she was beautiful to be sure. Small, barely noticeable freckles dotted her face, and she had straight, dirty blonde hair that fell close to her shoulders; some of those strands dangled over her magnificent aquamarine eyes evident with sadness. She sat alone, looking down at some papers while gently tapping her pencil on the desk as if she were bored.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked up when I walked in and held my gaze for a few moments before looking back down to her work. I forgot my anger and found a seat a couple of tables in front of her, sitting with my back to her, so I would not be tempted to stare.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason, I felt nervous. I found myself hurriedly pulling out things I would need to write: pens, headphones, my designated poetry journal, and of course my never-ending thoughts&mdash;though, I guess those weren&rsquo;t exactly in my backpack.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting comfortable (as comfortable I could be in the given situation) and situating all of my things just perfect, I set out to begin what I came to do: writing poetry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sat there, however, staring at the blank page in my journal, I found not a thing came to mind. I sat in silence with not even words to keep me company. I became lost in nothingness, forgetting even the beautiful girl who sat so close behind. The room transmuted into an expanse non-beleaguered by the grounds of reason, and its uniform rows of tables and chairs chattered blank statements.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not feel her behind me until she spoke softly near my ear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; she gently spoke. She was standing behind me with her hand close to my shoulder but not quite on it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry, I just kind of zoned out there.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed softly and added, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s okay I do that all the time. In fact, that is what I was doing when you came in.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why, but she made me smile. I introduced myself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rilke.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said reaching out my hand to shake hers. She took my hand in hers very gently and asked, &ldquo;You mean like the poet?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, like the poet.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s awesome,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;My name is Dyin Love.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her name captured me. Something was right about it, and I wanted to tell her that. But I (like a pretentious ass or, worse, an idiot frat-star) blurted, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s poetic.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What, my name?&rdquo; She asked with surprise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I assured her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; she said laughing as if I had made a joke. &ldquo;It was a birth certificate mistake.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh. Right, of course.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on she then asked, &ldquo;So what exactly were you doing that made you so zoned out?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, you can tell me.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I was writing some poetry. It&rsquo;s what I do when I come here.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure why I told her this, when I typically withheld it from others.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s really cool.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, I guess.&rdquo; I spoke dumbly like I was the frat-star once more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She giggled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, I became paranoid that she would look at my journal and see I had not written a single word, but she didn&rsquo;t. Her gaze stayed on my eyes, and when the moment had passed, she smiled brightly and questioned, &ldquo;Could you write me a poem? I mean you don&rsquo;t have to, but it would be really cool and I bet you&rsquo;re really good at it. You look like you are.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was surprised. No one had ever asked me to write them a poem, let alone a beautiful woman. What else could I say to her in that moment other than a sonorous &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hugged me with all her meekness. &ldquo;Oh thank you, thank you! Okay, I&rsquo;m probably bothering you now. I&rsquo;ll leave you alone and go back to studying my lines somewhere else so I won&rsquo;t bother you.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She waved at me as she went to her table to gather her things. I might have seen some green glitter fall from her things, but I couldn&rsquo;t be sure. I wanted to tell her not to leave. I wanted to keep talking to her, but she had left me speechless.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night passed as did many more. Every night I started to write Dyin her poem and every night I would erase and rewrite and redo and edit and get no further. Unlike that night in the library, I found words to say; but the more I read them, the more I saw they were not good enough for the likes of Dyin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, I would often run into Dyin on campus and we would trade words and even flirt occasionally. She would ask me how the poem was coming along and I would always report, &ldquo;Oh you know, it&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo; But in reality, I could never find the words to capture all that I thought about her. I mean, for God&rsquo;s sake, her name was like a poem or song title. How could I not easily write a poem for her? Something was wrong with me. I&rsquo;d never been this blocked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, one day when I faced another setback in her poem I stood up and left the library to take a walk. At first, I walked around the college. I passed by the rugby field where beneath burning lights a game was playing. I passed by the theatre, which advertised a Midsummer&rsquo;s Night Dream. Soon though, I grew tired of the school (getting no inspiration from it) and decided to go into the city.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I crossed over to the docks and sighted a man pressing a revolver to another&rsquo;s head. I hid in the warehouses, hyperventilating, fumbling over the keys on my phone. When the dispatcher answered, I couldn&rsquo;t speak. I dropped my phone and ran as I heard her ask for the second time, &ldquo;Sir, what&rsquo;s the nature of your emergency?&rdquo; As pressed through the alleyways, I slipped and lacerated my palm on fractured syringe. I cursed at the crimson that fled my lifeline but suddenly became silent. Across from me was a pale man&mdash;his eyes dead as the rest of him. His head was tilted back and smiling at the graffiti on the parallel wall. I never spoke of this to anyone.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days, weeks, months passed as I attempted to write that poem. I lost track of time and people, and walking half crazed to the cafeteria one day, I again ran into Dyin. She looked beautiful while I looked like a beggar. She smiled at me and we held conversation and like the times before. She asked me how the poem was going.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too bad Dyin, I think I&rsquo;ve most of it done,&rdquo; I lied.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, just make sure to have a strong end to it.&rdquo; She waved goodbye and turned going in the direction of the theatre. I didn&rsquo;t know what she meant by that so I left, not even going to the cafeteria as I had planned.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came back to my dorm and sat at my desk. Piles of papers lay strewn everywhere covering my room like a blanket of dirty snow. The window was open and it was winter, I think. A cold breeze blew into the room and tussled some of the papers slightly but making no more of mess than it already was. I sighed then laughed at myself. &ldquo;What the fuck&rsquo;s wrong with you? She&rsquo;s just a girl.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I lied down on the papers and closed my eyes. I knew I would never be able to end that poem for Dyin, and that was for the best.<br />

Dear Diary,<br />
December 72, 4036<br />
&nbsp;<br />
These boys like me, like they&rsquo;re in love or something, but they don&rsquo;t know me at all. It&rsquo;s like this college is filled with them or they surround the school waiting till I pass by and say something to them, as if what I said mattered. &ldquo;Looking they do not see. Listening they do not hear. Touching they do not feel. Partaking they do not taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; If they <em>knew</em> me, they would not like me. In the end, I am beyond perception; I am reality. In the end, I&rsquo;m just a girl.</span></span>
