I met Toni in Boulder at a diner that was once a used car lot. The smell of diesel and bacon grease clung to everything: forks, plates, bacon. The staff smelled like eggs and axle grease and dirty dishwater. The seats sagged under truckers of indeterminable mass. One of them was Danbo Snail, who&#39;d taken me on as his unloader and navigator and cigarette lighter on his long drive from Billings, Montana. I&#39;d met up with him in Casper. He had a trailer to pick up that would get me to San Antonio, and from there he&#39;d help get me to San Diego.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She came in and split the air, a wedge of vanilla, hammer of sage. A resounding crack of Jasmine. The bacon in my mouth transubstantiated into salted pus, which I spit out into my napkin, and I headed outside for a smoke. Half-way through my pall mall one hundred she stepped out. I heard the door open, but her smell made me ashamed of my cigarette, and I tossed it aside. She stepped close to my arm, leaned her head to within a hair of my shoulder and told me I was orange and grey and purple. Told me I needed to go north and west, needed to find my way by a river.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She half turned away. &quot;I&#39;m Toni. I&#39;ll see you again.&quot; With a step towards the door, she tossed a bracelet over her shoulder. I caught it, and there it was, a horse silver bracelet, two small beads to either side of the clasp.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It would&#39;ve been easy to call her crazy. I couldn&#39;t shake the scent. I couldn&#39;t stop starring at the bracelet. There was something there, long back, and I wanted to trust in trusting. I told Danbo I&#39;d unload him in Centennial and help him hitch up to his San Antonio trailer in Lakewood, and then I&#39;d be on my way. He handed me two hundred and nineteen dollars, half a carton of smokes, and a business card in case I was ever close enough to lend a hand again. He left me at a truck stop just outside of Lakewood. I waited for dark and took off on foot following 119.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It would&rsquo;ve been easy to call her crazy, but I wanted a direction, so I let the sage wind push me. Let the vanilla clouds comfort me. Let the Jasmine whisper gospel in my veins. I&#39;d start over by a river north of here.<br />

Sofie shows up with her nonchalant essential oils and hairy legs. She plops down with her beaded necklaces crashing. &ldquo;So, no camp. Dead guy. Feeling desperate. Was I your first call?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;No. Third.&rdquo;<br />

<div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</div>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">She shakes her head and pulls out a cigarette rolled in brown, unbleached paper. I hold out a lighter, but she uses her own match. &ldquo;Alright, I didn&#39;t think this was a good idea, but if you get me a coffee and a bagel I&#39;ll listen.&quot;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I take a moment to gather myself. She looks good, smells good. &quot;Alright, so, you know that thing in Eugene me and Dave and the rest were all in on?&quot;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">A nod.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&quot;Alright, so, my share is still there, in the camp, along with the odd job and panning money.&quot;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">She takes a drag and lets the smoke slide out of her mouth instead of inhaling. That&#39;s different. He stares at her lips. Thinner maybe?</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&quot;Alright, so, that comes out to twenty six thousand nine hundred seventy six dollars and twelve cents.&rdquo;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Sofie looks like someone punched her. Mouth open, confused. Then she giggles. &ldquo;You had me Elliot.&rdquo; She doesn&#39;t even wait for the coffee and bagel, she starts to grab her bag and stand up.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">No really, I have twenty six thousand nine hundred seventy six dollars and twelve cents, but maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said anything. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I&rsquo;m screwing around.&rdquo; I say.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Sofie stands, looks at me for a few moments and snubs her cigarette. There&#39;s a twitch, maybe it&#39;s a shadow of a bird, but she sits down and leans close. &ldquo;Wait. Son of a bitch. You really do don&rsquo;t you? Where. Where the fuck is it?&rdquo; I smell the tobacco and pear wafting up from her chest.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&ldquo;At the camp.&rdquo;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&quot;No shit.&quot;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I shake my head. &ldquo;Look, with the cops at the bridge and on the river they&#39;ll be suspicious of me.&quot;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">She rolls her eyes, then looks around quickly, &quot;you didn&#39;t have anything to...&quot;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&quot;No.&quot; I answer. I take a deep breath, &quot;I just need you to go for a quick jog on the trail, go to the fire pit, walk six paces toward the bridge, then turn away from the river, there&#39;s a big bush, behind it, a rock, under the rock should be loose soil and a bag with my haul. I&#39;ll wait right here and we can figure out what we do next alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
I probably should have expected that would be the last time I saw Sofie.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I look down at the bracelet and close my eyes, and smell the jasmine and vanilla. I hold on to a baby sometimes too, that someday Toni or Sofie or Laura or Anne-Marie or Rebecca will come around and give me a shot again, that I&rsquo;ll hit some big money or stop chasing my nose down to the water. How real is baby Hope?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Real enough anyway.</span></span>
