I&rsquo;ll wait to see how this ends.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents are gone. Mom went in some train cart without a fuss and Dad&rsquo;s bones are still propped on the side of what&rsquo;s left of the Prudential Building. Sometimes I go and talk to him when the night patrols transition. It&rsquo;s cold right now and the snow buries him, so I have to wait for the wind to blow it away or else I&rsquo;d get killed trying to dust him off.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s still smiling.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seen Mom since and I don&rsquo;t know where they took her, but the stories the others tell aren&rsquo;t good, so I said my goodbye.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister Alicja was pushed off the roof of our flat; I tried to bury her, but I was shot at before I could and had to watch the Germans use her body as target practice until there was nothing left. She was six.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My older sister Halina&rsquo;s death was worse. The Germans passed her around then put a bullet in her head, leaving her body where it lay in our flat. I cannot bring myself to go back there. She was nineteen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a year ago.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m showing you the bad, the ugly; it&rsquo;s the way the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine on us. It&rsquo;s why the garden lies in ruins. Just remember there is no space between you and I, there is only death.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll do well to remember that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am alone at sixteen.</span></span>
