<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; The cool water feels refreshing as it embraces me. I cup my hands under the running faucet, letting the water overflow before splashing it across my face in attempt to wash away the dark circles beneath my eyes. I grasp the sides of the sink and stare into the familiar blood shot eyes of the broken man looking back. I almost see a resemblance to someone I once knew long ago, before the unkempt beard and disheveled hair. It&rsquo;s strange to reminisce on those memories that now, don&rsquo;t even feel as if they belong to me. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m borrowing them from someone with an excess of happiness, so much that it overflows and falls to whomever is desperate enough to catch it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I dry off my face and maneuver through the disarray of empty bottles and half finished take-out containers, to the sole bottle of scotch sitting on the counter that&rsquo;s liquid barely fills a highball. Unsatisfied with a single drink, I put some clothes on, grab my jacket, and head downstairs. The only redeeming factor of this shitty city is the fact that the bars stay open all night.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; Rows upon rows of books tower over us as we stand the center of attention in a place where technology has yet to infiltrate. The old and worn out books seem undisturbed as if they are in their natural habitat. The distinguishable musty scent from the antique books flows freely through the room as Lilly and I stare intently into each other&rsquo;s eyes, trying not to giggle as the head librarian reads through the various passages that he prepared.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Off-white fabric is draped throughout the immense wooden bookshelves, and lights are strewn from the ceiling, creating a starry night appearance. Fake candles are set throughout the massive building, adding to the flickering ambiance. Lilly initially insisted that we use real candles, but I reminded her the potential problems from having open fire in a room entirely consisting of dry paper. The room looks majestic as if we are standing in the place that time forgot, like the stories surrounding us are protecting us from a crueler reality. Lilly had rearranged the books around us to her satisfaction: arranging Bradbury, Camus, and Wells in the order of her personal affection.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When we initially sent out invitations she had joked, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even matter who happens to show up, because the only ones that I really care about will already be there. Oh, and I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to be there too&hellip;&rdquo; She smiled, satisfied with her joke.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now that we are actually standing here together I realize how right she is in this moment--it doesn&rsquo;t matter who is here other than the two of us. The librarian/officiator combo-pack finishes with an obscure quote that only he and Lilly seem to understand. He motions to Lilly as he hands her a slip of paper containing her vows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jackson Steven Bennett: From the day we first met, I knew you were okay. I love your little quirks and how they make me laugh; you&rsquo;re random and weird, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. You&rsquo;re adoration for Curt Smith teeters on being not okay. You even sent him an invite to our wedding but it&rsquo;s okay because you gave me one too. I will love you forever and always, even if you happen to turn blue. I want to grow old with you, but not like Bella and Edward, because we both thought that was gay;. So I will be your Elizabeth if you&rsquo;ll be my Darcy, even though I know what you&rsquo;d prefer. So what I&rsquo;m asking is for you be my Maverick, and I can be your Charlie.&rdquo; Gentle tears trickle down her cheeks as she finishes her last line laughing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My eyes begin to water and I clear my throat, &ldquo;Lillian Alexandra Foster: you&rsquo;re the woman that I will never deserve, no matter how hard I may try. I&rsquo;m sorry that I&rsquo;m terrible at rhymes; my sixth grade teacher accused it of crimes. But I know one thing that I can do for you, is be yours forever as long as you&rsquo;ll be mine too. You&rsquo;ve been my guiding light when I&rsquo;ve searched for happy ever after. You are the reason fairy tales aren&rsquo;t myths. We can grow old together and even go coo-coo. We can sow the seeds of love forever. From the first glance you gave me, you seemed to stop the time, for in that moment I could see all the things that we would be. Now today I ask, would you be my lovely wife?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; The cold air feels refreshing to my face as I walk outside into the early morning darkness. Taking a cigarette out of the nearly empty pack of Spirits, I spin it around in my fingers a few times before actually putting it up to my lips. It takes a few tries before my faded gold zippo spurts a flame. It&rsquo;s the lighter that Lilly had found at an antique store and gave me for my birthday. She had it engraved on the front: &ldquo;Forever and always&hellip;&rdquo; Running my thumb across the letters, as I turn the phrase over in my head. Forever and always. Forever and always. Forever and always certainly seemed to have come quickly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My thumb habitually spins the silver band around my finger. Forever and always: a promise not kept. The pain feels as fresh now as it did five months ago. At what point does it start to dissipate? Does it ever become bearable? It&rsquo;s at times like these that I feel like <em>Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind </em>got it right:</span></span><br />
&nbsp;
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &lsquo;How happy is the blameless vestal&rsquo;s lot!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The world forgetting, by the world forgot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each pray&rsquo;r accepted, and each wish resign&rsquo;d&nbsp;</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; The feeling of stupidity and humiliation overcome me as my cigarette burns slowly. I savor the harsh tobacco, bringing a small sense of complacency to my cluttered mind. A train&rsquo;s horn sounds off in the distance. I start to imagine myself waiting there on the tracks as it comes for me. I stand there, absolutely still as it gets larger, the horn becomes deafening in an attempt to warn me away from the track. I close my eyes as I imagine the roaring train barreling down upon me. The brightness of the lights overwhelm me as I open my arms to embrace death. Would I feel my bones breaking as the train collides into me? Or would I lose myself to the white light?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I open my eyes. The train&rsquo;s horn sounds off in the distance. I look at what remains of my dying cigarette, the orange glow of the tip starting to fade.</span></span>
