&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My father was crazy, you know,&rdquo; <em>She</em> said to me in passing. I laughed. I did not know how else to respond.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I said, &ldquo;Does that mean you are crazy?&rdquo; again laughing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She playfully punched me saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious.&rdquo; I apologized as she looked down saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, we are all a little crazy these days.&rdquo; I waited for her to laugh but she never did.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Valentines. I have no love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took too long to get to Bydgoszcz. My shoes are filled with frozen blood. The journey was wild but not free. I had to hide and crawl and slink as if I were a snake in the garden.&nbsp; This is what I have been reduced to. Maybe like the snake, I am to be exterminated as an unwanted pest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My shoulder is raw from where my gun has rubbed on it. I have not taken it from my shoulder since the school. I have not had the stomach or the need to.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The white cat has followed me. Sometimes it is there, sometimes it is not, but it is always constant. Sometimes I think of it as a ghostly vulture looming over me, waiting for my inevitable passing. It never gets too close, nor does it ever stay far away. Part of me hates it, part of me longs for it to always be nearby. It is the only company I have outside of myself.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I reached the asylum. The nurse was right. The town is untouched by the war, yet it lies empty all the same.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The town grows more eerie the deeper I go, for there is not a living soul. There are not even ones in hiding. I know the signs. One can never truly hide, but there is <em>no one</em> hiding here.&nbsp; I look back for the cat, but it too is gone. My senses are vigilant.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cough and the blood have gotten worse, but I keep silent as I enter into the underground entrance of the asylum. Just because I see no one doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t anyone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse gave no direction of the antibiotics so I&rsquo;ll have to search the whole damn asylum. The unsettling quiet is sometimes pierced by sounds that come from nowhere and no one. As if the building groans at my intrusion. I step lightly so as to not anger it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room by room I go patiently. The place is largely untouched. It looks as though everyone suddenly left and they left all their things just as they were. There were dinner tables with food still upon them. Bread hard as stone. I see an ashtray where a cigarette burnt all the way to ashes.&nbsp; My logic tells me the war made them leave, but the place doesn&rsquo;t entirely feel that way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hope falters until I see a sign at the end of a long hall that reads &ldquo;Medical Station #3&rdquo;.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shuffle to it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things look to be in order. I frantically search the cabinets, forgetting the world, thinking only of myself, until I find a bottle that reads &ldquo;antibiotics&rdquo; in German. The irony does not escape. I laugh to myself. I read instructions about how much to take and swallow the dose.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit with my back against one of the cabinets, taking all this in. Medicine scattered on the cabinets and tiles. Disgust reigns over me. I have been alone too long, cared only for myself too long. I see a leather side bag nearby and begin sweeping all kinds of medicine and bandages into it, filling it to the clasps. One day I will get it right; I swear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I stand to leave, I hear a rupturing in the distance. It sounds like machines. My fear takes over. I run. Coming closer to the entrance, I can hear that they are not tanks but Flak 18&rsquo;s, huge cannons meant to take out aircraft, but there are no planes over Poland that aren&rsquo;t German. They are meant for the town. This realization comes to me as the first shell hits the asylum, shaking its foundation and bringing down parts of its roof.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My feet carry me fast out of the underground entrance. I look back only once to see the white cat standing in the entrance tunnel as the building falls around it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I run fast as shells rain down on the city shattering it. My senses tell me that this will be the end of me until I suddenly see a motorcycle flying towards me. I try to hide but I see a familiar face driving. It is Christov. He curses at me to get on the back of the cycle, and I do as we speed away from the city.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What the fuck were you doing Feliks!?&rdquo; He shouts behind his shoulders.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Getting medicine!&rdquo; I yell over the motor and bombs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shakes his head as we continue driving. The trip is silent until we come back to the edge of Warsaw.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he stopped, I got off of the back of the cycle to leave. He stopped me by saying, &ldquo;You know, my father stayed in that asylum for a while?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn to leave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you going now?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The hospital.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more words are spoken. Maybe none are needed.&nbsp;</span></span>
