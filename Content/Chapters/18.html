<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Until about a month ago, I lived with four other guys, and one night they decided to host a party. I don&rsquo;t mean get-together or small gathering, I mean a <em>Party</em>. The kind with an extra &ldquo;A&rdquo; after the &ldquo;T&rdquo; accompanied by four &ldquo;Y&rdquo;s, where you only know six of the fifty people, but by night&rsquo;s end you have made forty-four new best friends, and continue to remind each other that fact until morning. Sally stumbled into our party with her friend Jenny, who was invited by her sorority sister Amanda, who was roommates with a girl sometimes dating one of my roommates.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m will not lie to you; my memory of this affair is still fuzzy (once again not for the reasons you&rsquo;re thinking, so check yourself). Much like you, I arrived in the middle of this story&mdash;the party was an absolute surprise, not a <em>surprise party</em>, which is similar, but crucially different. My roommates had &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; to tell me it was happening.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was welcomed home by the loud bump of speakers and the unmistakable noise of sixty or so people talk-shouting through the music. I knew what would come, but after six hours working on a paper at the library, I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for it. All I wanted was sleep. The stench of cheap liquor, vomit, and piss-water-beer spewed out the front door. The collective entropy of the universe crammed into my living room. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following list of oddities is by no means comprehensive, nor does it include what happened before or after the time I was present during this madness:<br />
As I walked into the house, I noticed the door to the laundry room was removed from its hinges and laid across two kitchen stools to construct a beer pong table. We already had a table outside, but apparently one was not enough. There were two dogs in the back corner of the room, barking furiously toward the top of the standing lamp. This was confusing, until I noticed the cockatoo perched atop the lampshade, indifferent to the bellowing hounds below. This, however, did explain why the dogs were covered in bird shit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making my way through the crowd, I was able to see into the kitchen, where I bore witness to four girls wearing neon tights, sports bras and tutus. The first of these was vomiting into our trashcan, and the second was holding the first&rsquo;s hair and looked a little sick herself. The third was sitting on the floor next to them, back against the cabinets, legs straight out and arms at her side, ugly crying: tears, snot, stammering sobs, the girl was a pro. Lastly, our fourth inebriated beauty was passed out on the kitchen floor with her face planted in what I hoped to God was either water or beer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned into the hallway that led to my room, where I stepped over another lost soul, a pretty muscular dude lying on his side. He was clutching a half-eaten burrito, wearing most of the contents on his sternum. His face was a collection of sharpie drawings. Some of the most creative phallic images I&rsquo;ve ever seen actually. The poor guy wasn&rsquo;t even passed out. He was just immobile, groaning in oddly high-pitched tones.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I reached for my doorknob, sweet release within my clutch. I felt the cool brass move under my hand and then the door gave way, and then I remembered I locked my door that morning. I turned on the light and saw the outline of a figure beneath the sheets of my bed. I&rsquo;m going to say that again for emphasis.&nbsp;<strong><em><u>MY BED</u></em></strong>. Some drunk jackass popped the lock (if you turned the knob to the left hard enough the piece of junk would pop right open) and had the audacity to pass out in my bed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This interloper invaded the sacred space of my room, and (probably among other things) vomited on my sheets. I was tired. I was annoyed. But mostly, I was pissed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without pause or predilection, I flew into a frothing blood rage, shouting all manner of ancient curse, condemning this barbarous heretic to the deepest pits of hell. Not just any hell, the special hell, the one reserved for pedophiles and people who talk in the theater. In one fluid motion, I ripped the blankets from the interloper only to have every single bit of my righteous fury come to a sudden halt.&nbsp; Because what I thought to be a partygoer of the sweaty dude variety was the stark opposite. Lying in my bed, as naked as the day she came into this world, was our good friend Sally. Brain function ceased. The overhead light was on, I had the one blanket on the bed now in my hands, and Sally wasn&rsquo;t wearing a damn thing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sat up and looked me dead in the face. I recoiled, pulling the blanket to my chest (because apparently I&rsquo;m scared of naked women). Without breaking eye contact, she lifted one finger to her lips, and hushed, &ldquo;Shhhhhhhh, you&rsquo;re gonna wake Grandma.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without another word, she curled back up and fell back to sleep. I stood there stunned until it occurred to me to throw the blanket back on her as if it were made of leprosy and fire. Before I could develop a plan, or ponder whose Grandma she was talking about, a new voice tore through the clamor, an unpleasant one.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No means no, asshole!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I whipped my head around to investigate the source only to be greeted by the unrelenting sole of a high heel shoe careening into my face. However, if you had asked me at the time, I would have sworn to all things swearable that Bruce Wayne just crashed through my window and drilled me with a friggin&rsquo; batarang. I grabbed my face, and out of instinct a string of profanities suddenly appeared in my mouth that I didn&rsquo;t know existed. Before any other assaults could be perpetrated against my person I shouted,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;What the hell are y&rsquo;all doing in my room!?!&rdquo; These are apparently the nine magic words that can turn Batman into 110-pound woman prancing around in neon tights and a tutu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am so so so so so so sorry. I totally thought you were someone else.&rdquo;<br />
This would have been a perfectly understandable of they were not standing in <strong><em>MY</em></strong> room. My stomach felt uneasy, and a horrible thought crawled into my imagination.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who the hell else has been in here?!?&rdquo; I asked, clearly becoming more upset.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No one else, just me and my roommate; we&rsquo;ve only been in here like 10 minutes. Your roommate Steve opened the door for us, he said you wouldn&rsquo;t mind. I needed some place to put Sally to keep her safe. There&rsquo;s this creepy guy that wouldn&rsquo;t leave her alone and now she&rsquo;s too drunk to take care of herself.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at this point I realized she was one of girls I saw walking in. (She was girl two, the one holding her friend&rsquo;s hair.)&nbsp; I pointed at my bed. &ldquo;Is that Sally?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On cue, Sleeping Beauty sat up and shouted, &ldquo;Grandma!!&rdquo; The mystery girl&rsquo;s face dropped, because Sally was, of course, still stark naked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn it, Sally, where&rsquo;d your clothes go?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Clothes suck, Jenny, so I threw them away!&rdquo; Sally proclaimed and then fell back, immobile on the bed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jenny looked at me, and it was like looking into a mirror. She was tired, annoyed, and just wanted sleep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ok, here&rsquo;s the plan, put these on Sally.&rdquo; I handed her a t-shirt from my dresser and some athletic shorts from the floor. &ldquo;Once she&rsquo;s dressed, I&rsquo;m taking you both home.&rdquo; On paper, it looks like I was doing the right thing and taking care of these girls. Not really, I just wanted my room back. I just wanted sleep. It was only Thursday after all; I had crap to do the next morning.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jenny looked at me quizzically. &ldquo;Are you ok to drive?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My face dropped, and I swear my eye twitched a bit. I pointed at my backpack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been at the library all night, yeah I can drive.&rdquo; Jenny looked so happy I thought she might cry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked Sally to my car without any problems, surprisingly enough. They both sat in the back seat so I felt like their chauffeur, but the feeling quickly transformed into disgruntled soccer dad the second Sally began to sing &ldquo;Row, Row Your Boat&rdquo; into the little trashcan I had given her. Jenny gave me turn-by-turn directions all the way to their home, which was, as you might have expected, extravagant. Parked in their driveway were a Range Rover, Ford Raptor, Volkswagen Beetle, and Porsche 911.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They exited the car, and Jenny thanked me repeated. Sally was still singing into the trashcan, however, once she realized that I was leaving, she refused to go inside without a hug. So I got out of my car, gave an awkward side hug, and just before I escaped, she puked all over my shoes. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the story of how I met Sally. Now back to the bike incident, where was I&hellip; Oh, right. My soul was weeping because Sally had totaled her Porsche, and then hit a parked car with the Escalade. So that happened, and then Sally told me this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay though, when I hit the parked car with the Escalade there was a girl inside so we were able to talk about our feelings and exchange insurance cards. I friended her on Facebook and now I see her like ALL the time, it&rsquo;s like the best. Also, Jenny told me you took me home after that party a few weeks ago, I wanted to say thanks. Also, sorry for throwing up on your shoes&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finished untangling her jeans from her bike gears, the clock tower rang. In a fit of panic, Sally picked up her bike, gave me another awkward side hug through the bike, said something incoherent about partying together again, and took off towards the science building.</span></span>
