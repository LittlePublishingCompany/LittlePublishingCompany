<p><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)">Their shrieks pierce the night, calling the weak and weary back to this world. Wrath is their name, spawn of the angry ones. A small gathering on the far edge of the realm breaks out in turmoil. Across the way I see them, seemingly harmless in size but deadly none the less. Beady eyes and stubby appendages that border on the edge of cute do little to hide the truth in their cry. They are evil.<br />
<br />
Yet who can blame them? No words of grace&nbsp;to console, but stares of disapproval over their very nature from the angry ones. I am led to wonder, do the angry ones rage because of these creatures, or do the creatures rage because of their masters?<br />
<br />
When silence returns and anguish departs, I venture out as close as I dare to document these beings. May future travelers forgive me if all I can capture is their dwelling place: I dare not brave this trial alone.</span></span></span></p>
