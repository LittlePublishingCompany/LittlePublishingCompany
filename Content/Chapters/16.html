Blood traces a thin red line, stretching from brow to chin.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Evelyn,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m so, so sorry. You know how I can be.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;She rolls over silently, hoping the room will stop spinning.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Her ribs hurt from Jake&rsquo;s kick to her side when she was already down.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She doesn&rsquo;t speak; she wonders instead how much the children saw. How much they heard? Hopefully, they don&rsquo;t ask her what their dad meant when he was yelling <em>you fucking cunt! </em>and bruising her body and breaking her mind. How could she ever answer?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She will have to clean up the mess, of course. The table is askew. The red flashlight he threw at her is shattered everywhere&mdash; a fine symbol of her broken dignity. Her dehumanization and humiliation at the hands and fists of the one who once again broke his vows <em>to have and to hold</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Did the kids see?&rdquo; she asked Jake gently, trying not to rouse his anger. He was still standing close. Subconsciously, she is aware of her new ability to measure striking distance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I hope they didn&rsquo;t see the Christmas presents sitting on Jonathan&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; he said absently, not really responding to her question. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to return them if they did.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Okay&rdquo; was all she said, slowly making her way to the kitchen sink and letting the faucet run. The blood was drying quickly. At least its stain won&rsquo;t show of the deep brown carpet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She thanked God she didn&rsquo;t have to go to work tomorrow. It&rsquo;s not that she would have made excuses anyway.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Everyone knew Jake beat her; no one did anything about it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Jake entered his daughter&rsquo;s room silently.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The children sat huddled on the bed&mdash; flattened like paint against the wall.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>The bastard</em>, Jonathan thought. He had learned that word from his father a week before and had been scolded for using it. <em>He&rsquo;s going to attempt to apologize. No, not an apology. He doesn&rsquo;t have the decency. He&rsquo;ll offer an explanation</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I was angry. You know how my temper can be when I&rsquo;m angry.&rdquo; Jake looked everywhere but in his children&rsquo;s eyes. He often mistook fear for respect.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>He wants us to understand, to accept this flaw of character as reasonable and acceptable</em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He hugs us goodnight. Nothing like a father&rsquo;s protecting embrace, it was like hugging a fetid rat. His arrogance stinks. Sickeningly, nauseatingly, it lingers in the room even after he left. It claws at the walls, leaving marks and abusive memories paint cannot conceal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Shelly and I sit quietly for a while.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Neither of us had even reached the age of ten. She was only four years older than me and I hadn&rsquo;t even seen the first day of elementary school.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Neither of us knew what to do, or even if our mom was alive.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The second to last thing I saw while looking for a place to hide from daddy&rsquo;s hands was the kick to my mother&rsquo;s rib cage. The final thing was the remote control truck sitting unwrapped on the bed in my room.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I knew I&rsquo;d have to open the tainted present tomorrow; I&rsquo;d have to play with it and pretend everything is okay.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I also knew, above all else, that I&rsquo;d become a better man than him.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That night I promised my sister&mdash; and later my mom when we were alone in the car&mdash; that if he ever hurt my family again, I will hold his life as recompense.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The promise holds.</span></span>
