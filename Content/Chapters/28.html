<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time he died, my grandfather was a miserable man. The gregarious, woodworking scoutmaster that I remembered from my childhood had somewhere shriveled up, festered, and fallen away. I believe he died the day we moved him from the house he built with his own hands for my grandmother after the war, and into the dingy sterility of the veterans&rsquo; home. Like he had put so much of himself into the thing he made that once it was taken away there was nothing left of the man. He had built a world to live in, with heavens of cedar and cultivated forests of grass, and on a quiet afternoon, you could hear the creek outside like one of the four rivers of Eden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all of that had gone, and he had left his heart there, in a forgotten drawer of tools in his workbench. And he was taken out into the desert, to a veterans&rsquo; home on the side of a little hill, overlooking nothing, in the stifling heat of West Texas. A thing happens when you take away a man&rsquo;s heart, he first becomes hateful to himself, and soon after to everyone else. I knew for a long time that he hated me, by the way he glowered when I came into the room, the animal grunts with which he answered my questions and requests. But he treated everyone that way, and I&rsquo;ve come to think that he treated himself that way as well. With nothing much left to humanize, he could not recognize the human in anyone, much less respond to it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were only two times when I saw him reawaken as a man. I remember one day in the winter, when the family had gathered at our house for Christmas, and we had brought Grandpa out of the home for the holiday. He had shut himself away in the guest room, and I was sent to get him for dinner. When I opened the door, I saw him with his headphones on, listening to a cassette tape, a transfer from a record of Count Basie, Kansas City Powerhouse. You could hear the trumpet just a little bit, and for a second his head wobbled and his eyes smiled, and you could almost see him dancing in that old house he built when he was a young soldier, home from war.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I broke the spell when I came in, and the frown returned. And I wish I could say that I didn&rsquo;t resent him for hating me, but I did. So without any hesitation, I called him to supper, not caring what I interrupted. He grunted, angrily pressed &lsquo;stop,&rsquo; and hoisted himself from his chair without a word.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other time, I came home from college and, out of a sense of obligation rather than affection, I went to visit him where he lived. The home was forty minutes out of town and into the burned and barren wilderness. It had been so long since I had visited that I needed to ask the staff where his room was. When I found his room and pushed open the door that hung slightly ajar, I smelled his breath. The mixture of coffee, neglect, and medications created a powerful halitosis, like the reek of a slow death from the inside out.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there he sat. In an institutional chair in a bare room, empty hands, bowed and unable to straighten under immeasurable weight, pitifully crying. He was staring at his hands, his empty hands shorn of strength and skill and all their produce, and crying bitter tears. Tears for what loss and emptiness I cannot even guess. The grandson of stoic German Catholics, I hesitated, faltered, and finally walked over slowly and put an arm around his bent shoulders silently and uncertainly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For several minutes he continued to cry without looking up. Quietly, quietly. Until he took a deep breath, let out a long and shaky sigh, and told me &ldquo;Thank you, Marcus,&rdquo; without ever looking up.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never spoke about it. I finished my visit, asking about his food and the weekly bingo night. He told me about the cassettes he had found recently: Shep Fields, Louie Armstrong, Duke Ellington.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never asked, and he never told me about his crying.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said good night and I got ready to go. But in it all, throughout the later years of his life, there was something of fear. I laid him down to sleep before I left and just as I was going out, I could hear him in his sleep softly whimper with fear, &ldquo;No, no! I&rsquo;m not ready!&rdquo; And I understood that on top of it all, he was afraid because he could feel himself dying. His nobility had been taken from him, and what lived on was terrified of death.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the last time I saw my grandfather. He died during my last semester at university. My father called me between classes and, without a catch in his voice, with barely a tone, he told me &ldquo;Your grandfather passed away last night. We&rsquo;re taking him home to bury him with Grandma.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We laid him to rest, worn thin and looking haggard and angry, in need of rest, beside my grandmother, under a spreading willow, on the side of a green hill. I closed my eyes as they played Taps, and for a second I could hear the army bugler play as if it were a Count Basie horn solo. And a west breeze blew, and if I listened closely I swear I could hear a creek, sounding for all the world like a river in Eden.</span></span>
