<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My revolver was to the other man&rsquo;s head. I was about to pull the trigger when I heard her voice&mdash;it was scratchy and beautiful like an old copy of your favorite song.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gun? Why don&rsquo;t you use somethin&rsquo; more intimate, like this?&rdquo; she said, a bat in her hand. At the bat&rsquo;s end, nails curved jaggedly as if they had been forced in there unnaturally.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had fishnets on her legs and a dark skirt over that, a life vest over her upper body but nothing underneath. She was beautiful in that rough way that spoke of nails and sharp teeth behind a pretty smile. Her gray eyes stared endless pools into me, and her bright green hair was long and straight and fell somewhere behind her. She stood there patting that bat up and down gently, as I stood there pointing my revolver at the other man&rsquo;s head.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We stared at one another and without looking away she splintered the bat against the other man&rsquo;s jaw. She watched me a second longer then turned and beat him to death, heaving that bat up and down, up and down, blood splattering over us.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several minutes she stopped and kneeled, breathing heavily as if she had just worked out. Her lips curved into a smile. A disturbed look had entered her eyes; the sight of which shook even me, a hardened criminal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wrapped one arm around my neck while the other one still held loosely to the bloody bat and its jagged nails. Some of the nails were now littered with flesh, sinews connecting only to air. I leave her fever gaze and look to the man on the ground. He is nothing but a bloody mess.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;He will be your last,&rdquo; she said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My last?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Kill.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&hellip;&rdquo; I said, trailing off midsentence to give her notification to introduce herself.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dyin,&rdquo; she said without hesitation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Nick.&rdquo; My eyes settled to the eroded, bloody concrete, then I looked back to her. I pointed at her, &ldquo;Dyin. That&rsquo;s a pretty name.&rdquo;&nbsp; My voice was almost bashful.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, it is. Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked her immediately.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You go to the college or something?&rdquo; I asked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or something,&rdquo; she laughed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I questioned, &ldquo;So how&rsquo;s it my last kill? You assumin&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t my first?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We both know it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, I guess so,&rdquo; I said. This chick knew what was up.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She dropped the bat and gently took my revolver from my hand and put in the back of her skirt. She leaned in and kissed me so hard that I thought I tasted blood. There, in that moment, I saw a huge crossbones tattoo on her neck staring at me saying, &ldquo;Take her, and leave none for the rest.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She whispered in my ear, &ldquo;You can have me forever, if you leave your gang forever.&rdquo; I knew I would be with this girl until the very end. I nodded my head yes, almost like a child. She said, &ldquo;Good, then this is the end of everything.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked away into the night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime later we ended up in my apartment. The place was dark, messy. She wallowed in the trash like she knew it well, and the blood on her body ran off onto my floor, blossoming in the dark.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I walked backwards, she suddenly and violently threw me on the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those few hours, we made something like love. It even couldn&rsquo;t be classified as sex, because it was too violent. The same disturbing passion she had when killing the man she brought to the bedroom. Only here it was more terrifying, like she was trying to hurt me or herself. At one point she pulled out a knife. I tried to say something, but she placed the flat part of the blade over my mouth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime later we lied in bed covered in both our and the dead man&rsquo;s blood. Time had flown and so had latent beings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My eyes were closed as I spoke to her, &ldquo;Where do you want to be when the world. . . ?&rdquo; But my question was interrupted. Something small and cold was pressed against my forehead. I opened my eyes to see Dyin on top of me again, this time holding the revolver to my head.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; just before pulling the trigger. The blood must have looked beautiful to her.</span></span><br />
