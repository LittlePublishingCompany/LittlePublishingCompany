<p><span style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)">It began with an odd sense of amusement, the rabble of the horde seemingly trivial at worst. Little people with little complaints, unable to deal with the small set backs one usually encounters with those who have wings. Strong gust from the north crippled the pinion of the metallic eagles, holding them above and below the furious currents. Yet reason did not appeal to those gathered, death the more preferable option than squandered time.<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes became an hour, and then two before our winged beast and her consort were finally prepared. Near her neck I sat with eager anticipation to return to the land of my kin, yet more obstacles ensued. A lack of permission from the elder wings, another fifteen minutes, that which was to be carried along improperly fastened, fifteen more. All the while they sat and they simmered, occasional stabs flung at those who have wings. What once held entertainment, now yielded only resentment. How could they not understand, nature bows to no one?<br />
<br />
The last dreaded news, the guiding lights of our homeland has failed, shifting mist too low for our eagles to find their perch without&nbsp;beacons. I, at the neck, found myself first to receive restoration when I departed. Yet something occurred I did not expect. I was now the hesitant tip of a blood-thirsty spear. Before they sat, festering in the cocoons of the malcontent. Now fury had set itself at the head, insults and threats the weapon of choice.<br />
<br />
The angry ones are born.<br />
<br />
Respect is demanded but none given, and thus those who have wings have called their fire-bearers, an impressive show of force, salvaging the little order that could be found. Nevertheless, this land which once flowed with the hope of rekindled bonds now suffers for desperate relief. There is no lodging for us, we must contend on our own.</span></p>
