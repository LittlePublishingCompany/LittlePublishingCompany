<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Archetypes have labored as signs of age, virtue, and responsibility since the parturition of community. Some archetypes have endured. Others have been lost.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;When Carl Jung, the revivalist of archetypes, wrote, &ldquo;There are as many archetypes as there are stations in life,&rdquo; he left the door open. He realized archetypes would expand and wane with each epoch&rsquo;s succession and decay&mdash;each age has its stage and players unique from the rest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Today&rsquo;s archetypes are innumerable, sprawling. As we expand and grow, so does our list. The classical forms remain: The Innocent, The Orphan, The Explorer, The Sage, The Magician, The Fool, The Lover, The Mother, The Creator, The Ruler, The Rebel, The Hero; but we champion other forms just as powerful: The Performer, The Athlete, The Author, The Advocate, The Scientist, The Businessman, The Politician. These and countless others will write our epoch.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>How will you contribute? </em><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Archetypes are the &ldquo;contents of the unconscious.&rdquo; Subtle reminders to us of our place in community. Powerful tools of discovery. We might live into a dozen archetypes during our lifetime, or maybe one, but let us make the most of who we are right now. If you are The Visionary, dream. If you are The Craftsman, build. If you are The Artist, create. Whatever your archetype, just do your damned best, and we&rsquo;ll help write this epoch together.<br />
