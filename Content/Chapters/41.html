I&rsquo;ve been going over it in my mind, over and over, trying to find the words to tell you what it was like. I wish I could begin to explain what we were thinking, what we were feeling. Hate to say it, but maybe it&rsquo;s one of those things you just had to experience.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Everything happened so fast. Just the week before, we had been on the road together, making the journey for Passover.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">When I look back now, I can see that he was different as we walked to Jerusalem. He was preoccupied, pensive&hellip; He referenced the future, things that were coming. Honestly, it never made sense to us, so I guess we overlooked it. It&rsquo;s easy, I suppose, to see things in retrospect&hellip; And it&rsquo;s also easy to ignore things you&rsquo;d rather not see.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">One time, Peter addressed it&mdash;he pulled Jesus aside in his confident, blunt way. Rebuked Jesus for saying crazy things&mdash;for talking about how, &ldquo;He had to suffer, and to die.&rdquo; Maybe you think Peter was foolish, that he was being presumptuous&hellip; Thoughtless. Maybe that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">But when you look at it, I think Peter was afraid. I think Jesus scared him. I know he scared me.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><em>What would you do if your mentor&hellip; Someone who had become your closest friend&hellip; What would you do if that person started talking about how they were going to die? What would you do if they described the bloodstained fate waiting them in the days ahead?</em> It had been three years&hellip; Three years. We shared the big moments together. We saw incredible things. Miracles.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">But we also shared the daily movements. Some ways, those stick with me more. When we sat together, talking over long meals in the dusk. Miles and miles together, conversing along the road, falling into comfortable silence. When you spend that much time with someone, when you travel together and go through so much&hellip; You know them.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">He saw me at my worst&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible to keep your masks when you&rsquo;re with someone all the time.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">He saw me in the late moments when I was tired. He saw me on the bad days when I was discouraged and frankly, short-tempered&hellip; When I was exhausted from walking the day, when I was hungry and longed for something to eat. The intimacy that developed&mdash;how can I explain it?&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">But I&rsquo;m losing myself, the point of the story.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">What I&rsquo;m trying to say is, after all this time, all these shared moments, he had, in a very literal way, become the center of my life. All the details of my daily schedule were shaped by him. Where we went, when we slept, what we did. All of this was formed by our shared life together. Not to mention how I thought, how I saw the world, how I wanted to live and be&mdash;these things were also being shaped by him.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">So when talked about dying, it was unthinkable. <em>Where would we be then?</em> I couldn&rsquo;t remember what life was like before, and though there were moments when walking with him was difficult, I knew there wasn&rsquo;t anywhere else I would rather be. So that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t understand, perhaps even <em>chose</em> not to understand.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">But here we were, days later, after the worst had happened. After he had been seized, mocked, beaten, scourged&hellip; Put to death. After we had betrayed him. Denied him. Deserted him. Here we were, sitting wondering what on earth to do next.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">At that point, there had been rumors. We had heard from some of the women that his body was gone from the tomb, two men dressed in brilliant robes had told them he was no longer dead, that he had risen. But it sounded too fantastic. Outlandish. Unreasonable. Too <em>good</em> to be true.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">The eleven of us continued to gather together, I think, in part because we didn&rsquo;t know what else to do or to go. And because when you&rsquo;ve shared something like that, the only people who understand you are those who have also experienced it. We needed to be together.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">As we sat biding our time, two men&mdash;others who had followed him along the way&mdash;rushed in. They were afire, talking so quickly that at first we couldn&rsquo;t comprehend what them. But finally we understood.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">They had been walking to Emmaus, talking about what had happened, all the hopes we had and how they had been crushed. In the midst of this, a stranger came beside them. He began to talk, asking about recent events. He spoke of the Scriptures, about the Messiah. He spoke about the things that had happened and how they made sense, and in fact, how they <em>had </em>to happen. The two disciples who had walked with him talked about all of this very excitedly, while the rest of us exchanged frustrated looks. <em>How could this make sense?</em> How could you say this needed to happen, that it was good for it to happen?&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">They went on with their story, saying they arrived at Emmaus. The stranger tried to leave, but they begged him to stay and eat with them. So they sat down with him for a meal, and this strange man took the bread&hellip; And blessed it, and broke it, and gave it. At that moment, they said, they knew who he was. They were able to see, to realize that it was <em>him</em>. Jesus was this strange man that walked along the road.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">The eleven of us sat in silence, trying to make sense of it. It was a lot to take in, and like I said, it just seemed too good to be true. There&rsquo;s a risk in hope. A risk of letting yourself believe in the beautiful. It&rsquo;s a frightening thing. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">But then, all of the sudden, he was there. Right among us, in our midst. Almost like old times, we were gathered once more. I still remember it so well. Even thinking about it now my heart quickens.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I felt a strange tinge of excitement, of wonder&hellip; Could this really be? Here he was. Here with us. But my mind, which often speaks loudest, stopped me: of course it couldn&rsquo;t be him. He is dead. We all knew it. We knew it. That initial excitement gave way to humiliation, humiliation at my own foolishness in hoping&hellip; And then to fear, even terror.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">What was happening? &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Surely it was a ghost, a spirit, a hallucination&hellip;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Yet, a part of me dared to hope. What if? What if all wasn&rsquo;t lost? What if there was still a plan, still something breaking forth?</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&ldquo;Peace be with you,&rdquo; he said. <em>Peace be with you? Peace be with you?</em> As if we hadn&rsquo;t betrayed him, denied him, deserted him. As if we hadn&rsquo;t let him down in every way in his greatest need. But his words were not condemnation. He didn&rsquo;t call us out for how we had failed him. Instead, he met us in <em>our</em> greatest need. It was as if he knew this was what we most needed: Peace. He offered it before we could ask.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">It reminded me of when he used to send us out on journeys two by two to preach, to heal, and to cast out spirits. He&rsquo;d tell us to ask for hospitality&mdash;to accept help of the towns we visited. And when we went to their homes, he told us to say &ldquo;peace be with you.&rdquo; Now, he was saying it to <em>us.</em> He was meeting us here, in our home, so to speak. He was coming to us and requesting hospitality.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">When I think about it now, it&rsquo;s embarrassing, almost funny we didn&rsquo;t understand what was going on&hellip; The men who walked with Jesus to Emmaus were in the middle of telling us about their encounter, but when he appeared among us, we still didn&rsquo;t get what was going on. We still struggled to believe. Because there&rsquo;s a difference, you see, between hearing something and experiencing it firsthand.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">He asked us &ldquo;Why are you frightened? Why are you afraid?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><em>Why are you afraid?</em> Don&rsquo;t we all have a million answers to that question if we sit with it long enough? And in that moment, I was so very afraid. I was afraid of what would become of <em>us</em>. Afraid of what would happen if the Sanhedrin found us. I was afraid of going back to my old life, the way things used to be. I was afraid of my own darkness, the things I was capable of. I was afraid to see him now, to see his ghost, standing here with me&hellip; I was afraid of hope.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Then he told us to look at him, to really look at him, and see. And to touch. To experience him, his presence, firsthand. To see with our eyes and touch with our hands his very real presence.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Then he showed us his hands and feet. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I think the others were looking at these hands, these feet, marveling at the holes in each from the nails that had pierced through him, the nails that wrought him to that cross.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">But not me. I looked at these hands and feet and I saw stories.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I looked at his hands and feet and saw moments from before. They came rushing back to me.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">An image of his feet, wrapped in worn sandals and covered in dirt from walking miles and miles to meet with people, speak with people, heal them.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">These feet being washed and kissed by a woman in one of the most vulnerable acts I have ever seen.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">A quiet, sacred moment in a small village as the sun was setting, when these hands were placed upon the sick and weak who gathered. These hands touched them and healed them.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">These hands reached out to touch the unclean, the untouchable&mdash;those with leprosy&mdash;these hands made them clean.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">These hands reached out to take heads of grain while we were traveling. &ldquo;Take them and eat them,&rdquo; then gesture for us to do the same. To eat to our fill, even though it was the Sabbath, and we had been told not to harvest.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">These hands reached out to a young girl who had died. These hands took her and raised her up! They brought back life.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">These hands blessed and broke a few fish and loaves, then handed them out to feed thousands. These hands met needs.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">These hands reached out in the synagogue, in the midst of those watching, judging eyes, to touch a <em>woman</em>&hellip; And restore her.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">And these hands, only days before, took bread, and broke it and blessed it and gave it.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">These hands. These feet.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
