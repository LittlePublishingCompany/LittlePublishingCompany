The source of which was my last hope, the servants of the wings themselves. Long before the sun thought to kiss the morning horizon they came, with no regard for the broken. Their words crashed against the serenity of the night and laid it bare, placing despair, that pretender king of old, where one far more fair use to reign.<br />

Even now, as I finally sit with the remnants of the angry ones on the wings of promise, waiting to soar away from the dreary Terminal B, I feel as if I am leaving a part of me behind. Or perhaps, more terrifying if so, I have gained an unwelcome passenger. Amidst the teasing rest and false accommodations something worse has snuck by. I am frustrated. I&#39;m a little... angry.</span></span></span></p>
