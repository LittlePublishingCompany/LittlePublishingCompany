&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;There it stands, the public basketball court. It is defined by angles and painted lines; the court itself is surrounded by a metal fence that rises high out of the dust patch that is supposed to be covered in grass. A few crumbling bushes line the fence. Younger children wander near the burning playground set, aimlessly kicking gravel under their shoes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me get some water first,&rdquo; Rayshawn tells Leroy. Rayshawn heads toward an ancient water fountain near the dead bushes. He stands over the fountain and Leroy comes up behind him, peering over his shoulder. Rayshawn pushes the button. Nothing. He lets out a loud groan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on man!&rdquo; exclaims Rayshawn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; Leroy says.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is all Rayshawn says before kicking the water fountain with the sole of his foot. The fountain does not budge. Dust slides off the sides. Rayshawn kicks it again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken. It&rsquo;s been broken for a long time,&rdquo; says a squeaky voice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn and Leroy turn around to find a little boy pointing to the water fountain. The boy looks up at Rayshawn and bares his top teeth while squinting into the sun.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; Rayshawn spits.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; the boy replies.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leroy leans in and adds, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s right. You even kicked it.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, I know that. I&rsquo;ve been here before too,&rdquo; Rayshawn says, shooting a glare at the little kid. The little kid just shrugs and continues squinting into the sun.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn continues, &ldquo;I just thought they might&rsquo;a fixed it today. That all.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t never gonna fix it,&rdquo; the little kid declares. &ldquo;My dad says they don&rsquo;t ever fix shit out here.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Rayshawn says to the kid, whose only response is another shrug.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wanna play basketball now?&rdquo; Leroy asks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Rayshawn replies. The two boys walk toward the court entrance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they enter, the little kid calls out, &ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the court, the two boys take a corner of the basketball court. The rusty, creaking chain link rises up to hold them within their basketball world. Rayshawn picks up the basketball and jerks and feigns, dribbling it between his legs and around his body. Leroy shuffles to and fro keeping his arms out wide. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Rayshawn moves one way. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he flashes to the other. The boys continue their series of athletic moves and counter moves.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Rayshawn breaks toward the basket. His body keeps low to the ground as he plunges past Leroy. He jumps and makes the layup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grabbing the ball as he turns underneath the basket Rayshawn says to Leroy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;mma be Lebron James. I <em>am</em> Lebron James.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hah, no you ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Leroy laughs. &ldquo;Only Lebron is Lebron.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn dribbles and drains a jump shot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be better.&rdquo; He dribbles some more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pshh, my dad could beat you one on one and he&rsquo;s <em>fat</em>!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn stares through the concrete as he repeats crossover after crossover. His eyebrows rise and fall as thoughts strike his mind in waves.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I could too beat Lebron James. I practice almost every week. When I&rsquo;m 25 I&rsquo;ll be the best. I&rsquo;ll be the best, and Lebron James will be old. That will help too. I could at least go pro, or get a scholarship to college. North Carolina. Joe says there&rsquo;s lots of beautiful girls at college. I&rsquo;ll find a nice girl and have me a kid. I&rsquo;ll be a dad. Then I&rsquo;ll come back and beat Leroy&rsquo;s dad in one on one. He&rsquo;s a fat dad. I&rsquo;m not going to be a fat dad. And I&rsquo;ll know where I am. Leroy has a dad and he knows where he is. Somewhere north of Oakridge. He works as a policeman; Leroy said it once, &ldquo;My dad, who is a police man&hellip;&rdquo; I think dad is in Pittsburgh. I could say it too. &ldquo;My dad who lives in Pittsburgh, at least I know his name.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t the same. The words sound strange, too bouncy. Dribble. Dribble. Practice. I have to beat Lebron James so I can have a North Carolina girl and live north of Oakridge and not&mdash;</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLAP!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey! Throw me the ball.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leroy&rsquo;s voice breaks through the haze and he motions for a pass. His hands are held out in front of him like a mime&rsquo;s. His head cocks itself to one side. Two arms then drop to his side.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;BALL!&rdquo; he shouts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn realizes what his friend is saying. He sends the ball toward Leroy&rsquo;s chest with force and Leroy drops it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Leroy says as he goes to chase the loose basketball.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a fat dad!&rdquo; Rayshawn calls after him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that about my dad.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leroy comes up to the three-point line with the ball. He jukes and then jukes again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I can say what I want,&rdquo; Rayshawn replies.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two lock eyes and feel each other out. One. Two. Leroy makes a move and slips past Rayshawn who trips over his feet and falls to the ground. Leroy goes on to make the easy basket.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat Lebron James, Rayshawn. He&rsquo;s the king. You a fool.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn remains sitting on the ground wiping his scuffed hands across his sweaty shirt. The sweat stings his palms. Leroy is his friend, but he is not his best friend.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the chain door to the basketball court clangs shut. Five boys walk into the chicken coop. They drop a few backpacks in the opposite corner and turn to watch Rayshawn and Leroy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hoho, look at the baby on the floor.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that you Rayshawn? I thought we told you ain&rsquo;t good enough to play on our court.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t your court,&rdquo; Rayshawn mutters under his breath.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What you say?&rdquo; demands one boy in a bright blue tank top as he swaggers over to the younger boys.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing Jamal,&rdquo; Rayshawn says with downcast eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leroy steps behind Rayshawn and whispers, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn says nothing as Jamal towers over him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Jamal asks pointing a long, pointed finger at Leroy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my friend Leroy.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gimme that ball Leroy!&rdquo; Jamal yells. Rayshawn steps aside as Jamal snatches the basketball from Leroy&rsquo;s hands. Jamal then turns and pushes Rayshawn. Rayshawn falls backwards and catches himself on his hands. Tiny specks of concrete burrow into his already scraped palms. He turns over onto his knees, heaves, and tries to raise himself back upon his feet but at that moment Jamal hurls the basketball straight at Rayshawn&rsquo;s head. The force whips Rayshawn&rsquo;s head back, carrying the rest of his body with it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamal steps over his body to get the ball, &ldquo;Get up and play me Rayshawn, one on one.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn gets to his feet and faces Jamal. Rayshawn&rsquo;s torso twitches as he anticipates the ball. As the ball enters his grasp, the familiar stinging sensation spreads down his wrists.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Check.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn tosses the ball back to Jamal. The other boys line up against the fence and call out insults. Leroy stands silently on the other side of the court.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Beat his ass, Jamal!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Make &lsquo;em look silly!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamal smoothly, confidently swerves around outside the 3-point arc. Rayshawn, terrified, holds his hands out in defense. Jamal fakes and Rayshawn reacts strongly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ooh, look at him move. He&rsquo;s antsy!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamal fakes again, and again Rayshawn moves quickly to react. The continuous stream of laughter continues to flow from the periphery. Then Jamal makes his real move. He gets by Rayshawn and jumps so high that he almost dunks the ball into the hoop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; Jamal thunders into Rayshawn&rsquo;s face. He performs a victory dance around Rayshawn who clenches his teeth along with his fists.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Make it take it!&rdquo; Jamal says as he prances away from the basket. Rayshawn looks over at Leroy who watches the proceedings wide-eyed and motionless. Jamal bounces the ball this way and that. Eventually, Rayshawn slips, and Jamal pulls the jump shot. He makes it. Jamal retrieves the ball and performs a similar shot. He makes that one too. The sideline erupts into clownish jeers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn grabs the basketball before Jamal can get to it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn!&rdquo; Rayshawn commands as he hugs the ball. Jamal laughs. Rayshawn begins dribbling, slowly at first. Jamal continues to chuckle and mockingly jerks back and forth. Rayshawn rushes forward and Jamal lifts his left arm to let Rayshawn through. In the same movement he spins and shoves Rayshawn with his right arm. The powerful blow sends Rayshawn crashing to the ground. His body falls jarringly and he slides and rolls, all in the same motion, to a stop. Blood appears on his knees and forearms. For a moment Rayshawn lays there without moving. The sun beats him from above as the sharp concrete pricks him from below. Leroy lurches forward but catches himself as he sees Jamal gloating over his friend.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn clenches his fists and breathes in and out in staccato rhythm. He has to beat the fat dad and he has to beat Lebron James. He is thirsty. He feels lightheaded. Rayshawn&rsquo;s world shimmers around him as he lies on the burning court. Then the world becomes focused, just for a second.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamal lets out a yell of pain. He clutches his side as Rayshawn quickly withdraws his fist. The sideline becomes more serious. The other boys walk over and stand behind their leader. They push Rayshawn onto his backside. Rayshawn scurries backwards in a helpless and terrified crabwalk. Leroy is funneled in with Rayshawn as the group of boys corrals them into a corner of the basketball court. They threaten the two younger boys with their thicker, taller bodies. One boy barks like a dog. Another spits. Rayshawn is about to cry, whether from fear or anger he does not know. Then Leroy tries to run away but the boys push him back into the corner and into Rayshawn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman watches listlessly from across the street, reclining on a porch step, smoking a cigarette.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn lashes out again, swinging his fists violently and recklessly, he manages to strike someone&rsquo;s arm. Another boy sucker punches Rayshawn, and Rayshawn crumples to the ground. Rayshawn and Leroy begin to sob. They raise their hands to their faces to protect themselves from potential blows and insults, but more importantly, to conceal their tears. Jamal steps into the center of the ring. From in between his fingers Rayshawn sees that Jamal is holding his basketball. Jamal holds it in front of his chest. Rayshawn and Leroy continue to tremble, defeated on the hot concrete. They grab hold of the chain link fence but never turn away from their opponents. If something horrible and unexpected were to happen, they would at least see it coming.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamal says, &ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; and hurls the basketball at Rayshawn. It stings his sweaty shoulder.&nbsp; Rayshawn shudders uncontrollably, but he turns around, managing to keep his mouth shut and eyes fixed on Jamal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I said catch!&rdquo; Jamas shouts. He hurls the ball again and this time it strikes Rayshawn on the chin. The ball ricochets off and Jamal lets it roll to the other side of the basketball court, near the court entrance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Jamal says, &ldquo;You lucky I didn&rsquo;t have anything worse to beat you with. I just got this butterfly knife a few weeks ago an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s real nice. Maybe I should bring that next time, huh?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other boys laugh in agreement.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Leroy squeaks. He draws his breath in quickly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No?&rdquo; Jamal asks.&nbsp; He rubs his side where Rayshawn&rsquo;s fist had hit and then pauses.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Rayshawn he says, &ldquo;Rayshawn, hit me again, like a man.&rdquo; Rayshawn tenses.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamal continues, &ldquo;Where I can see you this time!&rdquo; An angry spasm jerks Rayshawn away from the fence. His shoulder jerks toward Jamal, but he restrains himself.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hit me, Rayshawn.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn breathes heavily. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He whispers, his voice choked up with tears.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No?&rdquo; Jamal asks, &ldquo;What do you mean no? Try and hit me.&rdquo; Rayshawn&rsquo;s fist relaxes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn holds his chin to his chest and looks at his sneakers. He sniffs and wipes snot from his nose, refusing to raise his gaze to meet Jamal&rsquo;s. The other boys stand around in anticipation, of something. Leroy coughs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Jamal says, &ldquo;OK then, get out of here. Like I said, you ain&rsquo;t good enough to play on my court. Just proved it right now.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost miraculously, the line of boys parts. Rayshawn and Leroy see freedom and they take it. The two run, as fast as they can, crying, towards the door, and once out Rayshawn slams it, still running, basketball in hand, away. Running away.</span></span>
