&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She</em> said, &ldquo;I wonder who&rsquo;ll stop the rain?&rdquo; She was standing outside of her mother&rsquo;s house, holding her hand to the sky as if trying to collect something.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I replied, &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t rained today.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed saying, &ldquo;But it soon will.&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A day after I had delivered the bag to the nurses at the hospital, the Nazis started bombing the city using the same Flak 18&rsquo;s they used in Bydgoszcz. Apparently, the garden needed weeding.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was beginning to feel better from the medicine and was coughing less now. I had not seen Christov since Valentine&rsquo;s. Back in the city, I found another loner, a girl of twelve. Her name was Roksanna. She had lost her family (seven brothers and two sets of parents) and she did not like people, but she liked me, so we stayed together for most of the day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roksanna has an odd way about her. Often she is silent but at times she will expel whatever she is thinking. Sometimes it&rsquo;s about rocks or trees, the garden&rsquo;s crumbling buildings&mdash;what they used to be before the war, and so forth. She has no weapon except for a knife, which she claims to have stabbed at least four men who have tried to rape her. She does not specify whether they were Polish or German. At this point, it is hard to discern who the real enemy is. Few of us care either way. Pain is pain no matter where it comes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were together east of the Large Ghetto when the shells began raining down. We were in the area where they were hitting and got stuck.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We run fast into a building&rsquo;s basement. Roksanna trips down the stairs and bangs her knee. I can&rsquo;t tell, but she may have broken something. She does not cry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky is ripped open by the sound. I have never heard the sound before and I don&rsquo;t think I will again. I am convinced I am now deaf. Roksanna is yelling something at me but I can&rsquo;t hear what she&rsquo;s saying. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I imagine she is reciting a French poem that my mother used to read to me as a child. Imagination does not cover reality so well though. I can see through the cracks that the world is shattering. Dirt erupts into the air like a child jumping into water.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roksanna is still yelling at me as pieces of shrapnel effortlessly pierce the walls of the basement, leaving it holey like a block of Swiss. Light would pour through the walls were the sky not darkened by smoke. This must be what rain is like in Sheol. It does not cool or grow; it cuts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roksanna staggers to me and starts shaking me, still yelling unheard, and then she goes for the door. I get scared and stand to stop her, but suddenly the demolition stops. There is a horrible calm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My ears are ringing and I know Roksanna&rsquo;s are too as she holds her hands to her ears and blood drips from them &ndash; I fear her eardrums are shattered. Moments pass without incident and finally we can communicate. I have nothing to say. I hear terrible screeching in the distance as she says in a yelling voice &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll stop the rain . . .&rdquo; She is cut off as a shell hits nearby and she is cut, splattering blood over me as I am thrown to the back of the basement hitting the wall hard.&nbsp; Parts of the basement fall around me as I lose consciousness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truth is, no one will stop the rain.</span></span>
