<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Down by the water there&#39;s a man that argues with himself. He sits on a bench some evenings and sings lullabies. &quot;Hush little baby, don&#39;t you cry,&quot; he&#39;ll sing, and look down in his lap, hands cupped around an infant of air. I wonder how real that child is.<br />
<br />
Real enough, anyway.<br />
<br />
In the sunlight hours he&rsquo;ll sometimes take off his shoes and walk fifty feet down to the river, and wade waist deep, and he&#39;ll hum old hymns and put his baby under the water. Depending on the time of year, he&#39;ll cry and leave his hands deep under, and walk to shore staring at them, like he&#39;s just seen them empty for the first time. Mostly, he leaves and cradles the newborn to his chest and coos at it.<br />
<br />
My name is Elliot. I&#39;ve been down here riverside for a few years. Sometimes I work. Sometimes I don&#39;t. Mostly, I just go between beds and couches, doing the work asked of me. I never did catch the man with the baby talking to anyone but the child or himself. He was just another John Doe hangin&rsquo; off the iron cradle of a railroad bridge in February.<br />
<br />
I suppose that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. I don&#39;t love Sofie, at least no more or less than I love Rebecca and Anne-Marie and Laura. All these women that want to save me. Each one has three outfits hanging in a closet or folded in a box. Whenever the river gets cold and the camps get empty and I look to go straight and narrow, one of &lsquo;em will come get me.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t love them like I love the river, but that John Doe and air baby showed me where I was headed. River opened up last night, and the water told me I&#39;d be hangin&rsquo; or floatin&rsquo; someday, with no one to know my name. No folks to care I&#39;m gone.<br />
<br />
Laura hung up just after I got done tellin&rsquo; her about the hanged man, said I told her a pulper about a dead cat last time and anyway, she had a boyfriend with a job at HP and I missed my chance. Anne-Marie moved back home to Louisiana. I love that gumbo but hate that swamp. Rebecca wasn&#39;t home, and part of me was glad, because I didn&#39;t want to be her secret garden anymore, didn&#39;t want her trying to weed me and tie me to a truss and point me at the light. And Sofie, sweet sofie, she listened and was about to say goodbye until I came clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cops tore down the camp.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a second I thought I was about to strike out, but Sofie pulled through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elliot, if this is about meth, I&#39;m walking.&quot; I could hear peanut butter in the back of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be at the bakery alright? I got a shower at the Y this morning and did my best with the mountain Jim on my face.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bakery was the only thing open that early. Most of the riverfront was fancy little shops and quarter million a pop condos, both lifeless fronts until about ten in the morning. But this little bakery and the Lebanese place had a war going. Every six months one would start opening fifteen minutes earlier. I think Mr. Farrah and Mrs. Stykagenon had a thing going on but wanted everyone to see the Greco-Levantine rivalry was alive and well.<br />
<br />
Hard to believe yesterday, right here at the same table, I was sharing a smoke with Grateful Dave while we watch the authorities cut down John Doe.<br />
<br />
Dave is a great beggar, blessed with a smooth rat pack voice and a clean, pale beard. He sits around in a red hoodie a lot, looking like a starved Santa, or in a suit he got from St. Vincent De Paul&rsquo;s, looking like a grandfather out of a photo from the Depression.<br />
<br />
But even he has given the nice people a day off from panning. No one works while they&#39;re disposing of John Doe. He&#39;d been one of us, even if not part of us, and so with a nod we all drift along. Dave looks over, &quot;Maybe we oughta check the camp now. The authorities are busy with &lsquo;em.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something felt wrong about it. &quot;I can&#39;t profit from the man&#39;s death,&quot; and I&#39;d rather not split with a crook like Dave, &quot;nah. They might think that was his spot if they seen us. Might think we hung him and took what was his. Best wait on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
John tugs his beard, and walks away to talk at a few of the shelter ladies.<br />
<br />
The money and the camp slip around to the darkside of my mind as I sip the coffee. I can smell again. Vanilla and Jasmine and Sage.<br />
<br />
Colorado. It&#39;d been a while since I&#39;d thought about it with so much scraping by. But now seemed like a good time to reflect.<br />
<br />
Death&#39;ll do that.</span></span>
