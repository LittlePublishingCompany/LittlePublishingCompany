He wakes to a whisper. Eyes still closed, one knee folding to his chest, he rolls away. This was their game, he and his mother&rsquo;s. He would wait, and drawing closer she would whisper: <em>Augie, wake my son</em>, and he would wait her petitions still until she was within arm&rsquo;s reach then he would stretch up and hug her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waits. <em>August</em>. <em>Augustus</em>. The voice moves no closer. The boy rolls once more, but the voice stays beyond his reach.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rigid shape strikes him and recoils into the dim below. He shoots up, seeing if Sister had hit him&mdash;if retaliation needed&mdash;but she lies in her unicorn comforter asleep. Leaning in the doorframe is his father who whispers as his child recognizes him, &ldquo;Backyard in five,&rdquo; then disappears.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room is subdued, barely lit with the sun&rsquo;s coming. The boy wrestles his sheets and places his feet to the cold linoleum, scratches his nose and creeps to broken Levi&rsquo;s. As he draws them up, a shape rolls off. He kneels. It is the rigidness that landed on him&mdash;a pitcher&rsquo;s mitt, unbroken.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing the mitt, he pulls up his jeans and puts shoes on without socks. He hunts for his cap and finds Sister hugging it in her sleep. He thinks about ripping it from her but knows better. Bareheaded, he steps outside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father twirls the ball with his forehand, bounces it on the molted leather of his catcher&rsquo;s mitt. Dewy grass dampens the boy&rsquo;s canvas shoes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy questions, &ldquo;Thought I wasn&rsquo; suh&rsquo;post ta learn it &lsquo;til I was thirteen?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father steals the ball from the air. &ldquo;Who said you were going to learn it?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy looks down and then to the field. Ladybugs flying near the fence line, resting on nodding dandelions. His father flicks his mitt, whispers, &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy watches him grip the ball across the saddle. &ldquo;Two fingers. Put the middle on the seam and turn your arm like this. See?&rdquo; He drops it into the boy&rsquo;s mitt. &ldquo;You try.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So I am learnin&rsquo; et&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Annunciate.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir. I thought you said&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I changed my mind. After this year, twelve is old enough. But we can always wait if you want.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; The boy sprints to the reddirt mound his father planted in the yard, white flecks of poison strewn across it, consecrating the battle of fireants. When the boy turns back his father is squatting, an imbalanced weight across his lips. His father punches his mitt. That ancient grit of leather quakes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy draws back his left arm, fumbling with the ball&rsquo;s laces. His father calls, &ldquo;Forget the wind-up.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No sir, I got it!&rdquo; The boy finds the saddle with his middle finger and grips it, brings it forward to his glove. He nods to his father and stretches his hands high like players he deifies on television. He folds his knee and brings his glove low, rifles the ball forward. It bounces on the earth and rolls across the St. Augustine to his father&rsquo;s feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You were so busy with that dadgum windup you forgot to turn your shoulder. You gonna listen now?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy turns to the fence line. Ladybugs jump stalk to stalk. He feels their laughter. His father sends the ball. It rebounds from the boy&rsquo;s new leather mitt, and he kneels to gather it. A tear branches down his cheek. He wipes it with the back of his hand.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Augie?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; The boy mutters.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy doesn&rsquo;t answer but grips the saddle tighter and throws the ball. It reaches his father with an angry bounce.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father stands and twirls the ball, sends it back to his son. He speaks, &ldquo;Better. But loosen that grip.&rdquo; The father squats, grimaces at threadbare knees, and sighs. &ldquo;All right, send it.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The party starts as the heat breaks. The St. Augustine is diamonded with bags, and the windows are nailed over with plywood. The boy and his team play in the dying shadows. In the bottom of the sixth, the boy hits one over the fence line into the neighbor&rsquo;s cowfield. His father scores it a walk-off, ends the game. Mosquitoes whirl in the blind dusk.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the house&rsquo;s den, his team eats ice cream and watches <em>The Lion King</em> on a TV-VHS. A gift the boy&rsquo;s Nana had given. Their eyes are fixed to the screen. Their lips stir with liturgy. Gasps thin the air as a lion falls to the stampede. They mourn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister breaks into the den, abandoning the bedroom where she safely hid from young lions. She stumbles, but their father catches her. She cries out, &ldquo;Light!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their father kneels, asks her, &ldquo;What, honey?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister raises her hand beyond their father&rsquo;s shoulder, reaching toward the window. &ldquo;Light!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the road in their Great Uncle Willis&rsquo;s house, a single room shines. Beneath 40 soft watts Avery stands, resurrecting a house long dead.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy and his team urge close to the window, rapt by silhouettes. The window&rsquo;s cross splayed in the grass. A cat hunting beetles on the porch. Avery.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy turns to Sister and their father. Sister sits on their father&rsquo;s shoulders, watching Avery paint his kitchen. Their father watches Nana. Nana sees the light and shakes her head, takes the ice cream maker outside the room.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A month passes. Balls lie scattered in the Saint Augustine. Calvin, the boy&rsquo;s only close friend, curses the boy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy shouts back, &ldquo;Then why ain&rsquo;t ya wearin&rsquo; glasses?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cause I don&rsquo; need&rsquo;em.&rdquo; Calvin squints and grips the handle tighter. Sweat channels down his pocked checks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ya sure?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pitch tha goddammed thing!&rdquo; The boy lifts a ball from a five gallon bucket and sends it. Calvin flails, stumbles to the St. Augustine. &ldquo;Goddammit!&rdquo; The ball congregates with others, nudging another at its end.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister&rsquo;s head breaks from the backdoor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna tell Nana y&rsquo;all is cussin&rsquo;!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy picks a ball from the bucket. &ldquo;If ya do, I&rsquo;ll hit you.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looks at the boy then runs. The boy throws the ball, sweat flecking off his forearms and wrists. It thuds loudly against the door, white vinyl staining dull aluminum.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Crap.&rdquo; The boy sprints to the door and closes it. Scratches the pale film with spit on his thumbnail. It does not rise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calvin sidles close, whispers, &ldquo;Should we run?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll only make &lsquo;et worse.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door swings in. Nana fills its dearth, her dress gamboling with airconditioned blow. Younger than other nanas, her hair is the russet of pine needles crushed underfoot. Her slender shoulders tendriled with anger. &ldquo;Sister says you boys &lsquo;av been cussin&rsquo;.&rdquo; She sneers the pale stain. &ldquo;An&rsquo; that ya threw ah ball at &rsquo;er.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy contends. &ldquo;<em>We</em> wus&rsquo;ent cussin&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Boy, you call me &lsquo;mam&rsquo; when I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; ta ya!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, mam.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What you gotta say &lsquo;bout my door?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy lifts the bill of his cap and rubs his scalp. Concedes the inevitable.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nana steps down the concrete and bends the boy over. She pops him twice and then releases him. The boy vows, &ldquo;Dad won&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo; She slaps the boy hard and swears, &ldquo;As long as ya under my roof, it don&rsquo;t matter what he likes. You do what I say. Now clean that door.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boys trudge to the shed and grab a pail and a couple oily rags. They fill the bucket with soap and water at the spigot and scrub the stain in silence. After it is clean, they gather missed balls into the bucket. Calvin points across the road. Avery is lacquering his porch with a friend. Both are smiling at nothing in particular.&nbsp;<br />
