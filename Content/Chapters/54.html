For many days I continued to run through my fateful and forming experience as a 5 year old. Over and over, I watched the film of the day, the run up the walk, through the front door, and hiding in the kitchen. I don&rsquo;t remember much of what occupies my days at the counseling center. I&rsquo;ve just been lost. Lost in my head. Lost in my thoughts. Afraid to come out. Currently, I&rsquo;ve refused the treatment center to inform my parents of my actions and current health. In other words, they have no idea I tried to kill myself. The benefit of America&rsquo;s highly individualistic society is that it makes anonymity, even with those who know you best, quite possible.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The university won&rsquo;t allow me back on campus for classes until the doctors have given me a discharge sheet assuring them I&rsquo;m psychologically capable to undergo the stress of an average student. I won&rsquo;t let them tell my parents &ndash; so going home isn&rsquo;t an option either. Thus, I&rsquo;m left remaining here at the counseling center as a quasi‐permanent resident. The doctors, like my teachers aren&rsquo;t quite sure how to treat me. So, they won&rsquo;t give me this coveted discharge. And frankly, I don&rsquo;t really want to leave just yet. I&rsquo;m close to something. I&rsquo;m not sure what. But I&rsquo;m close.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My treatment thus far has been non‐medicated and predicated on the idea that a good conversation can be more healing and helpful than any psycho-pharmaceutical. I tend to agree. Typically, I&rsquo;m asked every morning after breakfast what I&rsquo;d like to do for the day. I could say a couple of things. One, I could say that I&rsquo;d like to sit today. Or, I could say that I&rsquo;d like to go for walk, or participate in the other activities arranged for the permanent residents here. Or, I could tell them I&rsquo;d like to talk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to talk&rdquo; has become a bit of a code. It&rsquo;s short hand of saying I&rsquo;d like to go to therapy, a euphemism for agreeing that I have things that need to be discussed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I find it quite odd that in a place designed for those who are &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; they deliberately still address things and the situations in euphemisms ‐ in codes. If one is a resident of the Greene Counseling Center it is understood that this person has issues. These are not the benign therapists consulted in non‐reality television like the &ldquo;Real Wives of the O.C.&rdquo;, or whatever they&rsquo;re called. These aren&rsquo;t psychiatrists catering to those coping with being pampered their whole life. These doctors are for those who have plunged into the abyss. And, for the record, I&rsquo;m certainly fine with saying that some of the &ldquo;Real Wives&rdquo; should probably talk to some of these doctors. They&rsquo;re not immune from the abyss.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yet, even though these doctors know what they&rsquo;re up against, they still resort to &ldquo;Would you like to talk today?&rdquo; as if asking that lessens the reality that a few days prior he&rsquo;d slipped a hangman&rsquo;s noose around his neck and taken a dive. Saying things like that changed nothing. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t always want to talk.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Today was different. I wanted to talk. So, while eating my breakfast, I told the nurse, who doubled as a waitress, that I&rsquo;d like to talk. She smiled and said, &ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll tell the doctor.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The only time I escape the white washed world is when I talk to the doctor. It&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m given a glimpse of the real world, the world outside of euphemism and sterility. I step into his office. Bookshelves line the walls, oversized couches and chairs are arranged in a homey seating area around a fireplace that has long since equipped gas logs. The attempt is to make the lost feel at home; they&rsquo;re not fooling anyone. A bit of color never hurt anyone.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When the doctor arrives he sits down as if we were meeting at a coffee shop. He doesn&rsquo;t follow any of the stereotypes of writing on a legal pad, and filling the silence with excessive &ldquo;hmm&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;ahh&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He just sits and talks. Make believing we&rsquo;ve been friends for many years and know each other&rsquo;s most intimate secrets. I know the truth. It&rsquo;s still one sided. Still counterfeit of what I&rsquo;ve lacked my whole life.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It seems quite peculiar to me that I trust this doctor simply because he wears white and is presumed to be a saint of sorts, promising to heal my heart. I don&rsquo;t know anything about him. I don&rsquo;t know if he has a family. I don&rsquo;t know if he loves well outside the confines of the hospital &ndash; the place of mandatory love. It occurs to me, I trust him because it&rsquo;s expected I do so. It&rsquo;s an interesting thought. Why is it accepted that a doctor who is exempted from trust earned is allowed to demand trust?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As he sits down, he spills his coffee on his lap, letting out a hushed &ldquo;bastard.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not the slightest bit struck by what should have been perceived as a lack of professionalism. I simply dove backwards into my mind, thinking.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I remember the first time I heard the word bastard. I was on the playground at school. It was recess. Some high school students, more than likely, had come by sometime over the previous weekend and scrawled new words on the slide, only visible to those who would clamber up the structure for the thought of a 4 second thrill. I didn&rsquo;t know what the word meant.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More importantly, I remember when I realized what a bastard was. I remember when the word was actually understood as a profanity for more than the reason that my parents had told me never to say it. There was a guest preacher one Sunday morning at church. Because he didn&rsquo;t have to deal with the fall out of using &ldquo;profanity&rdquo; from the pulpit, he had the luxury of being a bit edgier than our pastor.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He told us people considered Jesus to be a bastard. I thought to myself, that can&rsquo;t be right. And then you realize, from the outside perspective, Jesus&rsquo; parents weren&rsquo;t married when Mary concieved. That&rsquo;s when I made the connection; that&rsquo;s when the definition resounded. A bastard was an accident. A bastard was from the outset an unwanted baby. That&rsquo;s when I realized I am a bastard. When the high school students scribbled those letters on the slide, they could&rsquo;ve written my name instead &ndash; &ldquo;Thomas.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I asked the doctor what it meant to be an unwanted child. He&rsquo;d just been sitting while my thoughts wandered, waiting for me to come back to him; he was completely unaware of what sent me sailing in the first place. He hadn&rsquo;t heard me. No answer came. So I muttered it a bit louder. As was his custom, he answered with another question.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Why do you think about things like that?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s important to me.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, I know. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out why.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In this moment, I realized that trust expected is not nearly as powerful as trust earned. For if I trusted the man in the white coat, I would have cried out immediately why I more than anything needed to know what an unwanted child was. I would have screamed to define that paradox, define the tension between those words. Why did I not tell him this?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I did not tell him this, because he had uttered the word. He had alienated himself from me with two simple syllables. My trust expected for him could not withstand the blow of utilizing the idea of an unwanted child to express brief, momentary pain he experienced from spilling coffee on his pristine lab coat, as if his momentary pain was synonymous with the pain that had permeated my life. It seemed demeaning; it seemed like something so much more than a simple slip of the tongue. When he first uttered the word, I wasn&rsquo;t offended. Having been seized by such violent memories in the recesses of my mind, there&rsquo;s nothing I could have done to have not been hurt, wounded ‐ by a doctor no less.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Trust expected is of no avail in curing the ache in my heart and healing the hurt in my soul. I began to think of all the people that fell into the category of trust expected &ndash; my teachers, the doctor. Did my parents fall into this category? Was it simply understood that I ought to trust them because they were the ones who had provided for me, because they were the ones who paid the bills, bought me clothes, fed me, and took me to school? I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the category they fall into as my &ldquo;caregivers.&rdquo; Could those who so willingly gave into the chasm that circumstance had wedged between us ever be a recipient of trust earned rather than expected? I don&rsquo;t think so. Why did they have to run scared from the gap? I don&rsquo;t understand.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Rushing over me came the reality that a bastard, an unwanted child is a paradox. Can the words &ldquo;unwanted&rdquo; and &ldquo;child&rdquo; ever really go together? It seems that by nature a child is a thing that ought to be wanted. At least it seems that way. A child is defined by his family, by those who have claimed him, called him their own. It is this proclamation of ownership, of belonging, that provides the ammunition for the child to fire light and beauty into the night without fear of the night overcoming him. The bastard awakens at night and there he stays. Fears accompany this child instead of imaginary friends and play things. The various shades of night permeate his soul, rooting deeply, making his heart their abode. It is wrong for a child to ever fall into this category. An unwanted child is not simply a paradox; it is an evil.<br />

&ldquo;Thomas. Thomas come back.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I didn&rsquo;t want to come back. The recesses of my inward being I explored were by no means safe or comfortable, but they seemed so much less scary than the real world. I didn&rsquo;t want to come back. I wanted to be done. I wanted it all to be over. I regretted telling the nurse I wanted to talk; I had put myself in the position where I must confront the darkness. It&rsquo;s an awful night when the darkness that comes with closing your eyes is brighter than the dark your eyes see when open.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Thomas. Thomas come back.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I didn&rsquo;t want to come back. I heard myself whimper and I felt the cool tears begin to run. I was either locked in tunnel vision or had my eyes closed. The tears fell. The coolness eventually turning to a cold burn on my flushed cheeks.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I hurt so bad.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Thomas come back.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I want to go home.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;You want us to call your parents?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;No. Listen. I want to go home. I&rsquo;m tired of all this.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Tears flowing freely and the sobs becoming louder, the doctor simply reached out to touch me on the shoulder, expecting the bond of physical contact to somehow ameliorate the situation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I want someone to want me. I don&rsquo;t want to be a bastard. I don&rsquo;t want to be touched &ndash; I want to be held. I want to be cared for. I want to be healed. And you, Doctor, know nothing of this.&rdquo;
