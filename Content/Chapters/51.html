<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I remember once being dropped off at home by one of my playmate&rsquo;s parents when I was 5 or 6. We went to the same school and so our moms worked out a deal where they traded picking us up and dropping us off at home. This day in particular was special. I knew &ldquo;Memaw&rdquo; and &ldquo;GPops&rdquo; were going to be at home when I got there. You can imagine, for a 5 year old, this was a fantastical thought. Suddenly, the routine of the school day became quite boring. Being the teacher&rsquo;s helper, building the most complicated castle small wooden blocks would afford by poorly tuned fine motor skills, coloring and learning about different types of clouds could not and would not hold my attention. As far as my estimation would show, two people that loved me more than anyone had already arrived at my house and were more than likely contemplating what we would do first &ndash; feed the ducks at the park? Go for a walk? Let me show them how I could ride a bike WITHOUT training wheels?<br />

Needless to say, I told my teacher every 5 minutes why I was so happy. For a typically melancholic child, any day that any significant amount of happiness was shown was sign of something &ndash; even if my teacher didn&rsquo;t know what. Looking back at many of my teachers&rsquo; actions towards me, I realize that more than likely they were at the very least suspicious of my home life. While I never showed even the slightest form of physical abuse &ndash; no mysterious bumps, burns, or bruises. I suppose looking into my eyes day after day, week after week, and month after month, gave them a glimpse into the face of deep despair. I&rsquo;m not sure if they suspected emotional abuse or that some tragedy had befallen me and my parents were simply too proud to get &ldquo;help.&rdquo; In retrospect, my teachers very obviously reached out in ways they could. I was always given a bit more freedom in my schedule than most of my classmates, especially when it came to English. I was a poor grammarian but had an incredible imagination. My teachers read deeply into each one of my one‐page, handwritten stories, hoping, praying that some clue to me as a person would shine through in an unintended archetype or accidental metaphor. It never happened. My teachers were simply left to be content with being 3 feet from my body and 30 miles from my heart.<br />

This day, the day when Memaw and GPops came to visit, I was more like a kid they knew. I was giddy. I was chatty. 3:00 pm could not have come too quickly. I knew my grandparents felt the same. I clambered out of the backseat of my playmate&rsquo;s car and ran up the front steps. We had a winding side‐walk, an immaculate yard (which my father demanded I never play on, that&rsquo;s what the backyard was for), and a wraparound porch that made for a bit of an obstacle course for short, determined legs like mine. I was sure they were there. I ran across the threshold of our home, anticipating the exuberant and thrilled embrace to come, maybe a kiss from Memaw.<br />

It was quiet.<br />
<br />
My house was normally quiet. But not this quiet.<br />
<br />
Something like a sob came from the kitchen. I peered around the corner.<br />
<br />
Mommy was crying.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;You ruined your life.&rdquo; The voice had the same pitch, octave and tone as my GPops. But it seemed alien. It was if he had picked up my voice changer toy and inserted a filter that augmented a caring voice with hate.<br />
<br />
I cried.<br />
<br />
What happened next is a bit of a blur&mdash;a 5 year old has both the luxury of unwillingly forgetting portions of his life as well as the uncanny ability to block those things from his memory that have the ability to cause a great amount of pain at just the slightest reminiscence. A blessing and a curse. A frustration for any unsuspecting therapists, licensed or otherwise. My teachers being a prime example &ndash; if only he could remember some of those awful things that happened to him, we could fix him.<br />
<br />
At some point, my GPops realized I had been present for at least part of the conversation. He immediately shifted back into the person I&rsquo;d always known him to be &ndash; kind, caring, perfect, a superman of sorts. He swooped down, kissed me, and walked out the back door. Apparently Memaw had never come inside and never meant to come and visit. GPops came for the sole reason of having a conversation with my mother. Thinking about this later, it seems rather ridiculous for my grandfather to come down to our house just to shame my mother. But then again, humans are irrational to an unbelievable degree.<br />
<br />
After this visit, I learned quickly not to expect Memaw and GPops to come and visit us. Never again would I spend a day at school in complete euphoria, blinded from the realities of the world around me. Because the days of noticeable excitement were so few in the first place, my teachers never noticed a significant enough change to realize that something catastrophic had actually occurred in my 5 year old life.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, mom or dad would drive me the hour and half to my grandparents&rsquo; house; they lived in a small town outside of our city. The would simply pull up into the drive, let me get out, make sure I made it to the front door and then leave promptly, avoiding any form of communication. My grandparents would then drive me back home the next day and complete the same routine my parents did. Except for the small amount of time we spent in front of either home, the relationship I shared with my parents and grandparents was warm, &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; Those few momentsin enemy territory were cold. They were sterile. As if they were merely delivering a package rather than a person.<br />
<br />
I never found out what exactly was said during that conversation. All I know is that it cemented all the things I&rsquo;ve already talked about &ndash; my parents being somehow unable to bridge a gap between us. In reality, this conversation could have been one of many rather than a singular event.<br />
<br />
Imagine this tension. I am simultaneously loved and that which caused another&rsquo;s love to die. My mom&rsquo;s parents no longer speak to her. They love me. They hate her. Sure, this hate may have been born out of disappointment and maybe was never even meant to turn into hate. Just the same, I exist in this creational reality. I have created love. And I have destroyed it.</span></span>
