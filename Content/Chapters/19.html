&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was losing consciousness when I heard a sweet voice close to my ear. I looked to my right and sitting next to me was this peculiar, beautiful woman. Owls, knives, dice, flowers, and lightning bolts, all bursting in color, covered her arms and legs. I even glanced puppy tracks beneath her sports bra. Her curvy, snow-colored hair was joined into a ponytail held by a red streaming bow. (Maybe it was the trip, but her eyes seemed pallid too.) She stared at me as if she were waiting an answer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She replied, &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Do you want to end your own life?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep within the curves of my stupor, I remembered a quote and muttered it to her, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard, &lsquo;Dyin&rsquo; is the day worth living for?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo; She said with a gentle smile etching her lips.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I blabbered.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My name is Dyin.&rdquo; She said loudly like I was either deaf or a foreigner.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed. I really was tripping.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well <em>Dyin</em>, I&rsquo;m Stacey.&rdquo; She laughed at my name, but said nothing. We sat in silence until the trip wouldn&rsquo;t let me be silent. I asked, &ldquo;What are doing here, Dyin?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without hesitation she answered, &ldquo;Waiting for the end.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The end of what?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed again. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; I said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She eyed the purple circles on my veins and the blood smeared on my forearm. She smiled and asked, &ldquo;But really, what are you doing here putting that junk in your arm?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my end, Dyin. I&rsquo;m just waiting for my blood to make new flowers for better playgrounds.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Sounds nice, but you seem like more.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;More what?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like my high was leaving me. I would have considered her a buzz kill if I didn&rsquo;t like being around her for some reason. She made the dingy street corner beautiful, like a flower that sprung between the crack of a sidewalk, going toward the light no matter what.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Just more.&rdquo; She said matter-of-factly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was silence, not the awkward silence as before (that most people find themselves in), but the comfortable silence that happens between two people who are completely at ease with one another. During this silence, she leaned over and gently pulled the needle out of my arm and tossed it violently to the street. In earlier days, I would have killed her for doing this, but not now. I felt no anger to this girl named Dyin. I only felt relief.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes searched my eyes. Then she asked, &ldquo;So, what did you do before you started waiting to die?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared back into those almost milky white eyes of hers and answered. &ldquo;No one has ever cared to know.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I do.&rdquo; She whispered.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still looking at her I muttered, &ldquo;A graffiti artist.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Like the ones hired by the city to clean up the walls near the college?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, like those.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Was your art good?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The best.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So what happened?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I painted the truth. Men don&rsquo;t like the truth.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sounds sad.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking down, away from her, I answer, &ldquo;It was.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, there was the silence; the peaceful one that brought a reprisal I had not felt in a long time. We sat there for several minutes not saying anything, just enjoying the other&rsquo;s company, as if presence alone were enough.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long time, she stood up and I saw her full beauty before me. She reached out a hand and offered, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s take a walk.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded, and as I took her hand I struggled to stand. She smiled at me when I reached my feet. &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; she whispered. Dropping my hand, she skipped playfully ahead of me, eventually rounding a corner and leaving my sight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling, I hobbled forward and rounded the corner. It was an alleyway filled with shattered syringes. Dyin&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t amongst the fanged cylinders. I palmed my face then looked at my hands, wondering if she was only part of the high. But I could tell the drug and its effects had left. She was real and she was gone. Exhausted and defeated I leaned against the wall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few breathless moments, I finally lifted my head and faced the opposite wall. A mural was colored across it just like the graffiti I used to spray. <em>Dyin</em>: She was painted across the bricks, sitting, looking at me with that smile of hers. Her gym shorts and sports bra were there, so were the tattoos, white hair, and albino eyes. Even the red bow was there holding up her ponytail.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her expression said, &ldquo;I know something you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;, while the caption below her picture simply read &ldquo;The End&rdquo;.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words stung me. I stopped looking at the mural.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closing my eyes, I started hobbling again. This time in more pain. I rounded the corner, back to where&hellip; I was. Painfully, I made my way back to one of the syringes on the ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could do nothing with the shattered instrument, but saw its liquid on the ground. I leaned down and began licking it. It stung gently as it erased my pain, sweeping through me, claiming its stake.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dying is the day worth living for.</span></span>
