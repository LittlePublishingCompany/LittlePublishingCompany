<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It should go without saying that the encounter with Sally was an unexpected shake-up to my day. Boy, if I only knew what was coming&hellip; and I&rsquo;m not just talking about dying. That actually happened so quick that it took me a bit to figure it out just what had happened. Best not get ahead of myself. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spoil anything for you. But you can imagine how exhausted I was after dealing with both the blunt force trauma that was Kurt&rsquo;s &ldquo;special&rdquo; brand of evangelism and completely re-living that party with Sally. I looked at my watch and my jaw kind of hung askew. I felt like I had run a marathon, but somehow only forty-odd minutes had passed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it dawned on me, almost all at once. It happened as I rounded the corner of yet another red brick building. (Say what you want, at least the architects were consistent.) It was the sudden realization there was a hole, gaping and wide, in the center of my soul. It was the same shape as a cup of iced coffee. It needed to be filled, and off in the distance across an asphalt river Jordan, I could see it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sat there, the Promised Land, filled with to the brim with wonder. Tables full with over-caffeinated students studying material feverishly that in some way, they had already forgotten. Wild-eyed writers hunched over their laptops and black coffee, slaving away at the next Great American Novel, or Oscar winning screen play, or maybe just shitty fan-fiction (after awhile it got hard to tell). Lastly, over-worked, underpaid, and sleep-deprived baristas who, against all odds, still managed to put on a smile every time they were conscripted into explaining the subtle differences between a macchiato and a milk shake, and that Frappuccino wasn&rsquo;t a real word.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, so maybe it was just the local coffee shop across the road but what can I say I love coffee shops&mdash; holy shit&hellip;. they better have coffee where I&rsquo;m going. Anyway, with my sanctuary in the distance, I placed my earphones in and queued up the next song in line. It was a mesmerizing beat that matched my walking pace. Left right left right left right, I fell into an almost trance, letting my thoughts wander and my hunger for caffeine compel me forward.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t gotten far (crossing the desolate concrete wastes of Not-very-far-istan), when something to the right caught my eye. It was a young man. He stood tall in trendy sandals around six foot two with a curly head of sandy blond hair, sultry hazel eyes and a rock climber&rsquo;s build, which I can denote with confidence because of the <em>super</em> <em>cool</em> shoes that were hanging from his canvas messenger bag. The bag was covered in pins and patches from local shops and various travel destinations. Lastly, who could fail to notice the subtle statement made by the djembe under his right arm. It was everybody&rsquo;s favorite Biochemistry&mdash;Mechanical Engineering, Pre-Med double major: Easton Van Hoop. However, I always <em>affectionately</em> referred to him as Wonder Boy. God, I fucking hated this guy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst part was that he was genuinely a great person, not a single fake bone in his body. His parents were missionaries, and he grew up all over the world. He was fluent in four languages. He started a charity freshman year that works all over the world helping the impoverished and the downtrodden, and I&rsquo;m not talking short-term fixes. I mean long-term sustainable solutions that really help people.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I know this much about a person whom I supposedly hate you ask? He was my University roommate the first semester of our freshman year. I had the <em>privilege</em> to spend an entire semester with the most &ldquo;<em>wonderful young man</em>&rdquo; that had ever graced the Earth. At the end of the semester, he was getting more letters from my Mom than I was. (Which, if I&rsquo;m being honest, made both Easton and myself equally uncomfortable.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought to myself maybe if I walked fast enough he wouldn&rsquo;t notice me. I began to drum up my excuses in case he did manage to notice me through his <em>majestic aura.</em>&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hear him over my music, and I didn&rsquo;t have my contacts in, and the sun was in my eyes, and screw you, all your accolades and southern charm make me feel bad!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can remember my internal monologue: <em>It&rsquo;s not that I actually dislike Easton that much, really, if we&rsquo;re going to boil these feelings down to their simplest parts. I just don&rsquo;t like the way he makes me feel about myself. Honestly, if I could place him in a vacuum, we&rsquo;d be fine. But when you live in juxtaposition with a guy like that, it makes everything you do seem insignificant. It&rsquo;s like every time I talk with this guy, he just took a big steamy&hellip; Oh, shit he saw me.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, Luke!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Luke, watch out!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Jordan&rsquo;s stormy banks I stand, and cast a wishful eye! </em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;JESUS, TAKE THE WHEEL, LUKE THE TRUCK! JESUS H. CHRIST, LUKE THE TRUCK!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a little farther, I can almost taste the&hellip; Is that a&mdash; Chevy?</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, lets take a moment to talk about fear. There are several kinds of fear. There is laughing fear, like when you go through the neighborhood haunted-house, or ride on a roller coaster that goes backwards. There&rsquo;s anxious fear, the kind you feel as a professor works their way down the row of desks handing back an exam that you know you bombed or when you know you&#39;re about to be dumped. There&rsquo;s also that irrational fear people have, of bugs, or melted cheese. (Ugh, again with the judgment.) All of these things can be perceived as mostly harmless, but then, there&rsquo;s that other type of fear. It&rsquo;s the kind of fear that starts just below your rib cage and works its way up, manifesting itself as a contorted version of your face. I call this one &lsquo;Brown-Pants Fear.&rsquo; But I wasn&rsquo;t wearing my brown pants.</span></span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"> The world around me seemed to slow down, moving frame by frame. My momentum pulled me further and further off the curb, far too late to react. The truck was moving much the same way I was, frame by frame towards me, far too late to stop or even slow down.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then I felt the tight grip of a man&rsquo;s hands on my right arm and left shoulder. The grip was strong and unrelenting. This person&rsquo;s hands felt like they were made of some kind of sand paper. Even through my shirt they still felt rough and callused, they felt like the hands of a&hellip; carpenter. As I was pulled backwards away from the oncoming compensation-mobile (That&rsquo;s a big-ass truck for all you civilians)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel the rush of the displaced wind sting my eyes and batter my hair. I fell to the ground, mostly unsure of what had transpired until&mdash; a fucking djembe rolled right in front of my face. Not proud of this next part, but the first thing I thought to myself was &ldquo;<em>Why couldn&rsquo;t the truck have just hit me</em>?&rdquo; Kind of ironic looking back now, don&rsquo;t you think?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rolled over, hoping someone, anyone else was lying on the ground next to me. However, how could it be, of course Wonder Boy had saved my life.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Whew, that was a close one bud, you ok?&rdquo; he asked, ever so genuine. I responded in kind with a very gracious thank you and made sure he was also ok. Not sure why, all he did was save me from being leveled by a compensation-mobile.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then it got worse. Once we had stood back up and gotten our bearings he looked at me and said &ldquo;Glad you&#39;re ok man, that was a close one. We really should hangout sometime, I wish I could stay and chat but I&rsquo;m late to a missions meeting. Send me a text and we&rsquo;ll catch up and get coffee.&rdquo;<br />
And just like that. He was gone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t even let me get a word in edgewise. It was like saving my life was part of his usual routine. Brush teeth: check, Wash Face: check, Save a life: check. I waited until he was definitely out of ear shot and looked around to make sure I was alone and said to myself aloud, &nbsp;&ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;<br />
Then I turned and headed for the coffee shop.</span></span>
