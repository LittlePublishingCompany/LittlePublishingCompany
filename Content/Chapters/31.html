<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Nana Steiner sold her brother&rsquo;s inheritance the June before the family moved to Tekoa. She called it the <em>old house</em>, her childhood home. It was her father&rsquo;s inheritance until he died thirty years earlier in Pyongyang, and it was her brother&rsquo;s inheritance until the syphilis wrest his mind. She sold it to pay for his care.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Avery bought it, it had not been lived in for ten years. Twenty since any work was leveled on it. The roof lanked. Shingles lumped in the weeds like shitpiles. The walls vomited splinters where centipedes and black widows fought. The pipes were rusted dry like droughtland arroyos, vestigial souvenirs of paradise overcome by thirst.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nana thought Avery would tear it down and start afresh, but he came with lumber in the bed of his F-100 and began revival. Every Friday, he would arrive in the afternoon and work, only breaking when it was too dark to see. He slept on the house&rsquo;s floorboards with the raiding, piss-colored weeds. He rose with Saturday&rsquo;s light, again worked until it was too dark to see, and would leave that night without speaking a word to the townspeople. For fourteen months, this is how Tekoa understood Avery.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister would watch Avery from the den window. She said there was something familiar about him. She asked if he had a wife. Dad answered that Avery looked too young to be divorced, so he assumed Avery was a man who couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t get tied down.</span></span>

The Saturday morning before school&rsquo;s return, Avery&rsquo;s F-100 is missing. Sister watches the old house. Avery painted it salmon and cream and stripped the old shingles, bedding new ones blackened with tar. Roses needle up. Chinaberries shudder mildly in the draft. The boy asks Sister to play with him, but she does not move.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late that afternoon, the boy pitches into a rebounder. Balls ricochet toward his shins, flogging him with dull thuds. He throws harder, angry at his loneliness. Calvin has left with his mother and started private school. The boy must make a new friend.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shakes his arm. The static in his fingers does not go. He throws until his sinews numb and the sun quits.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stands the rebounder in the shed, gathers the scattered balls in the twilight. His eyes center the old house. He remembers Avery, and the man, and the whiskeycolored lacquer. Their shared smile. Something powerful burns in the boy, but he mistakes it as rage. He sends a ball at the old house, through the window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Crap.&rdquo; His eyes broaden like cynical desert plains toothed with dim glass. His throat dries by that same wild star. He almost runs inside, tells Nana it&rsquo;s an accident, but pride grounds his feet. He knows what he must do.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He crosses the road.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d been in the old house once before. Two summers ago when they visited Nana. His cousins said it was haunted, that Great Grandpappy Willis came back from Pyongyang and drove Great Uncle Willis mad. The boy said it was a lie. The cousins dared him to go across, step within its derelict walls. The boy did. He ran back screaming.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy looks back&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t been discovered yet. He continues through the Japgrass, dropping to it as a car passes. He crawls to the frontporch. Its lacquer still glows like Jameson on fire. His palms stick a little to its boards, so he stands and crouches up the steps. He reaches the carved walnut door, grips the bronze handle. Deadbolted.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy rattles the handle, but eventually forfeits and sits with his back against his antagonist. He begins to think of a lie. Bivouaced below the porch swing, a manged cat hisses at him, beats the air with a calico paw. The boy hisses back, and the cat retreats through the broken window. The boy unbuttons his shirt and wraps his hands. He grabs the window seal and passes a leg inside the den. As he passes the other, he feels glass fang through his shirt. He stifles a scream.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glass flakes beneath his weight. The den is striped except for two walnut bookcases and an antique loveseat. A cream rug pairs the walls. The boy steps around the rug as he searches, anxious of tracking glass in it. He moves past the stairs into the kitchen, where Avery had painted as the boy&rsquo;s team watched. The backwall is lined with stainless steel utensils.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood slowly wets the boy&rsquo;s shirt. He stretches his pitching hand, feels the viscid humor slip down his fingertips to the hardwood. He moves back to the den. At edge of the cream rug, the loveseat stands. He searches below. The ball rests between calico paws and luminescent eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy reaches out, but the cat bats his shirted hands, further tearing his buttondown. The cat hisses, but the boy pushes against the cat&rsquo;s leprous throat with the shirt segment between his hands pulled taut and takes the ball. The boy stands. The carpet below is stained with glass and blood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy hears gravel shifting in the driveway. Through the absent window, he sees a F-100 and a convoy behind it. He runs through the kitchen to the backdoor, its top vertically barred. He jumps for the latch but is not tall enough to reach it. A voice behind him speaks, &ldquo;Avery?&rdquo; The boy turns. A slight man, throat hidden by a knotted sweater, speaks again, &ldquo;I found your prowler.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery walks in followed by a dozen men. Half of them are well suited like the slight man. The other half are wearing clinging tanktops and high shorts barring bearded thighs. Avery is in jeans and an undershirt with eyes partially covered by a ballcap. He lowers a baseball bat and looks over the half-naked boy. He sees the ball and bloodied shirt and motions to the slight man, &ldquo;Joe, could you get my bag?&rdquo; He asks the boy, &ldquo;What you got there?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy doesn&rsquo;t speak but holds up the ball.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe returns, hands Avery the satchel. &ldquo;Did you see what he did to your den?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, I saw.&rdquo; Avery opens the satchel and turns to his guest, &ldquo;Go ahead and start. There&rsquo;s a Pioneer in the backroom if you want to listen to something.&rdquo; They leave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery pulls alcohol and peroxide, asks the boy, &ldquo;You Charlie Steiner&rsquo;s from across the street?&rdquo; The boy presses against the backdoor. Avery sighs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that as, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo; He points to the boy&rsquo;s shirt, &ldquo;Unwrap that.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why? What are ya gonna do?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Doctor you.&rdquo; Avery pours alcohol then peroxide on the boy&rsquo;s hand. The boy breathes coarsely but stays still. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going need stitches. I&rsquo;ll call your father, see if he can take you to the ER.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy whispers, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy speaks up, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Daddy&rsquo;s at work, and Nana&mdash;I can&rsquo;t let Nana know.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know your father&rsquo;s work number?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery nods. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about right.&rdquo; He sighs, &ldquo;Let me get a needle. Stay here.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy thinks about running but stays. Music turns in the back of the house.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my spine,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my orange crush.</em><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy feels fur worm between his legs. It&rsquo;s the manged cat. &ldquo;I guess you wanna be friends now.&rdquo; The cat licks its paw. &ldquo;Okay, but I ain&rsquo;t givin&rsquo; ya my ball back.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Avery brings a chair into the den, lets the boy sleep on the loveseat. He&rsquo;ll repair the window in the morning, tarps it now to discourage the mosquitoes. Joe comes in. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing your party.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery smiles, &ldquo;We both know it&rsquo;s not <em>my</em> party. I hate parties.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe points to the boy, &ldquo;Is he going to be fine?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I imagine.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You imagine he&rsquo;ll pay for my rug?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t imagine that at all.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a better man than me.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avery laughs, &ldquo;Joe, that isn&rsquo;t all too hard.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waits until he sees headlights in the boy&rsquo;s driveway. He carries the boy to his father. The father&rsquo;s eyes are tired, bruised with insomnia. The father apologizes for his son, offers to pay. Avery refuses.</span></span>
