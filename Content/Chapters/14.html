&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"> &nbsp; &nbsp;I tap the bar again, waiting for the familiar sound of the bottle being poured. Instead, I am met with Jessie&rsquo;s voice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I gotta cut ya off, Jack.&rdquo; She can&rsquo;t mask her condescending tone as much as she might try.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I want another.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come back tomorrow Jack&hellip; Or don&rsquo;t. Whatever.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wake up on the floor of some sleazy motel. <em>How much did I drink last night?</em> Good God, my head is killing me. I look around the room to find clues that lead me here, but to no avail. I walk out to hail a cab back to the misery within my apartment. The sunlight scorches my fragile eyes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk into my apartment and it immediately hits me, &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; My nightmare is in fact bitter reality. Wood, blood, and glass still litter the floor. I head for the nursery, searching for any apology that could even begin to account for my actions. Not only does not such apology exist, but also there is no sign of Lilly anywhere. I walk into the bedroom to find most everything of hers missing. The only possession she left behind rests solitary on the bed, a small orb. My knees buckle and I reach out, catching myself against the door, tears streaming rapidly from my eyes.</span></span>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">***</span></span></div>
<br />
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stumble into my apartment and immediately head for my room. From the nightstand beside my bed I pull out a small wooden box. Gazing with awe at the work of art that lies there so calm and harmless, I lift the gun from its place as I&rsquo;ve done several times since the night Lilly left. That was the night that I realized how little I actually deserve to live, <em>for what is there to live for?</em> Everything that mattered is gone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That familiar whirring sound sings as I spin the cylinder; it always seems to bring me a distorted pleasure. I spin it again and again just to hear that soft but distinguished whir as it taunts me with an intimate promise to relieve me &ldquo;forever and always&rdquo; of pain. I glide my hand slowly across the exquisite craftsmanship, tracing my fingers over the intricate designs alongside the black barrel to the golden frame that&rsquo;s been etched with precision. I&rsquo;ve always loved this gun, a gift from my grandfather long ago.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A twisted wave of excitement comes over me, as it often does when I play this game. Butterflies flutter about my stomach as I wrap my fingers around the darkwood. &nbsp;The revolver feels natural in my hand, as if it had been built for me. I raise it and press the muzzle firmly to my temple. Slowly, I cock the hammer and breathe in the air of exhilaration. My body begins to react to the situation, sending my heartbeat up my throat and into my head. The lively beat is thunderous.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this be the moment the lone bullet escapes from its cage and finds its way into my waiting skull? One in six are the odds that I don&rsquo;t wake up, five to one odds that I do. <em>Is one fate any worse than the other?</em> It may as well be fifty/fifty, it either comes or it doesn&rsquo;t. I close my eyes and think of Lilly, of the pain and suffering she went through because of me. I wasn&rsquo;t there to hold the miscarriage. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s my fault we drifted into the dark abyss. <em>It&rsquo;s my fault. It&rsquo;s my fault entire.</em> I take slow and steady breaths to calm my heart. I don&rsquo;t want it to be the last thing I hear. I&rsquo;d rather listen to the mockingbirds&rsquo; sweet serenade just outside my window. I can make out a few of the colored lights that line the streets, the bright glow that I once loathed now looks serene, beautiful. &nbsp;I inhale and taste the air for what could be the last time. My finger rests taut on the trigger. <em>Here it goes, fifty/fifty.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My finger pulls hard on the trigger- <em>click. </em>That ever so soft click from an empty chamber is all I hear. The revolver continues to taunt me as it maintains possession of that single bullet, hidden somewhere within. I let go of the breath I held in and lower the weapon to my lap. Lilly&rsquo;s words run through my mind, &ldquo;Forever and always&hellip;&rdquo; I failed you Lil. Tears slowly trickle down my cheek. I raise the gun back to a gentle rest against my temple. Dying is easy. &nbsp;Living is the hard part.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ready for death to pick me up and carry me onward to whatever lies beyond that mysterious veil. I spin the chamber one last time; I feel like this is it. The bullet may as well have my name engraved on its side because it&rsquo;s coming for me, and I stay here to welcome it freely. I scribble something quickly on a piece of paper, fold it and address it, &ldquo;Lilly: wherever you are, I hope this finds you.&rdquo; Okay, this is it, all or nothing- <em>click.</em></span></span>
