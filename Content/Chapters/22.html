<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)">Those who have wings have promised safe passage to return to my homelands--news that causes delight.&nbsp;I must, however, return to Terminal B, that uncertain land where the angry ones claim dominion. It is an arduous journey, leaving the haven of Terminal A and my fellow wanderers, riding the backs of hovering beast back to desolation. What took such short time to escape now rejects my return, the hovering beast traveling to A, then C, E, D, and finally back to B. This world makes no sense. Echoing voices taunt my every move as I promise, repeatedly, &quot;I will remain seated. No, I won&#39;t block the doors.&quot; Some small fortune, I have found shelter upon my return, a small berth on which to lay my head near the outskirts of the angry ones. They wail over lost privileges, and rage in haunting laughter. I prepare for the oncoming night.</span></span></span></p>
