<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-size:14px">We abandoned the fire. In World War II, we &ldquo;sent seven million Americans overseas and opened their eyes to reality,&rdquo; and when they came back they had &ldquo;suddenly lost patience with the slow rhythmus and glancing allusions of the novelist. Overnight, America became a fact-minded nation.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Today, America is a nation of pragmatism. A nation of flickering screens and hungry fingertips, where fact is conflated as Truth and information is the standard of literature.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fiction has long been berated, abused, forgotten.&nbsp;We, the nation of Faulkner, Hemingway, Melville, Twain, and O&rsquo;Connor, have become artistry&rsquo;s wasteland. Some, like Cormac McCarthy and Toni Morrison, have toiled to bring us back, but still we languish.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We are a nation of a hundred and forty characters of vacuous savagery. A nation where civil discourse has died and is lost in the dust beneath our feet. We are a nation eroded, our firmament broken.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have lost something. We have lost everything. We abandoned the fire.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The campfire is a reminder that we need stories, that we are lost without stories. Stories change us, push us, mature us, but most importantly, they connect us to others, because no matter if you&rsquo;re in the dusty plains of Texas, or stargazing in the Pacific Northwest, campfires bring people together. Campfires are communities of story and rest. They require our isolation and information addiction scorched away and that we feel the fire in our hearts once more.<br />
