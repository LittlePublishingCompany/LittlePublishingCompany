January 24, 1943</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am good where I go, moving through the shadows, going through the cracks of the places forgotten by those who don&rsquo;t look there anymore, places where the bodies don&rsquo;t pile up anymore, past the schools still taking place in the sewers, past the graveyards marked by sticks, leaping over the piles of rubble, past the few idiots still walking the streets freely, past the dead and the dying, past the broken clock store, past <em>her</em>, up the stairs, around the corner at the top of the building and into a room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dusk in the winter, and snow is falling lightly with those big puffy flakes that stick together but make for slippery roof crossings. I shiver violently in the room. The roof looks as though it was blown up recently, making for a colder night, but I don&rsquo;t chatter my teeth because I never know who&rsquo;s listening.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to cry. It was bad day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking down to the street I see <em>her</em>. I can&rsquo;t take my eyes from her. I asked her to marry me not long ago, married her even sooner. I had snuck into the flats next door and no one was there so I took a blue ribbon from a Chester drawer. It was long so I cut a small piece from the end for her and took the rest for myself. She laughed as I got down on one knee and presented her the ribbon. She said yes and I tied it around her ring finger and I put the rest of the ribbon around my neck as a sort of necklace. She was seventeen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shot her crossing the street five nights ago, and her body was run over by a tank.&nbsp; I look at her, but <em>I do not look at her</em>. Her face is gone, just frozen brain matter splashed across the broke plain. The ribbon&rsquo;s ends blow in the cold breeze from her finger as that hand is raised in the air as if grabbing for something that is not there. I fear she did not die easy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here the bastards come. I watch them from the scope of my rifle as they sneak in the shadows like the dogs they are. They are worse than the Nazis&mdash;scavengers looking for money as if it would do them any good now. They spy her body destroyed and see an opportunity.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deer rifle is cold in my hands and heavy, but I&rsquo;ll carry that weight a long time. I only have nine rounds, but I&rsquo;ll gladly waste two on these fools. I&rsquo;m praying they miraculously line up that I only use one bullet, less waste and possible attention that could be brought to my room. The tall skinny one stands as a look out, he is closest to me, the other leans down to Adrianna to check for whatever he can find.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s still listening as I squeeze gently on the trigger, sending a bullet through the top one&rsquo;s head at an angle to go through the other one&rsquo;s too. Blood sprays all directions, freezing almost instantly. Their bodies fall listlessly and I crack a smile. My lips bleed from being so chapped; like their blood, it freezes. But I am satisfied.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shot echoed throughout Nowolipie Street, shattering the silence of the neighborhood.&nbsp; I quickly flip the reload lever up and pull it back, releasing the spent shell onto the floor of the room; its clatter is drowned by the echoes of the actual shot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wait for reprisal: soldiers, tanks, bullets flying, potato mashers, rockets, something, anything: but there is nothing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All is silent again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watch Adrianna as the night settles in overhead and no one else comes to disturb her body. The night patrols haven&rsquo;t been by and I make my way slowly downstairs. There are holes here and there throughout the stairs, but I&rsquo;ve memorized them in the light, so I can make my way over them in the dark without being seen by eyes, dead or living.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on the street now and no one is in sight. The ground is slippery and my movements hindered. I look to my left and see a distant lone street light near one of the German soldiers&rsquo; barracks. At the moment, there are no soldiers in front of it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk slowly to Adrianna&rsquo;s body and I stare at her for what feels like hours until I gently lift her smashed body, grabbing her by the arms. She is too heavy for me to lift, which I&rsquo;m sure she would hit me for thinking. I gently drag her as well as I can to the back of the building that was once her home. I do not go far before I reach it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a dark alleyway with nothing in it but memories and bodies. Somewhere someone wishes this was just a place to throw trash, but they have forgotten what it was for those who used to use it. It is home to me though. Adrianna&rsquo;s home. It is her mother&rsquo;s garden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay her down quietly in the snow and undo my rifle from my shoulder and I turn the butt of the gun to face the ground and start digging. There are no more shovels in the garden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the first grave I had to dig.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hold her hand one last time as I tell her I love her for all that she was and all that she still is. I kiss her dirty hand; the dirty hand to a seventeen year old wife of a sixteen year old husband whose hands are so beyond cleaning.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s life in the Ghetto; life in the garden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to cry, but to do would be dangerous.</span></span>
