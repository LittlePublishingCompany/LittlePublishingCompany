<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Sofie sits up, her breats hurting, her body reminding her she should have gotten pregnant. She slides out of bed, assuming child&rsquo;s pose and breathes, murmuring, &quot;Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,&quot; (like her body pretending she needs to be a mother) &quot;The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She unfolds into downard dog, thinking about the last few months. The halfway house to this, her own small space, community shower to private tub, Tanya cooking every night to subsisting off sardines and peanut butter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She rises, the sun still meekly hiding behind the valley&rsquo;s cloud roof. Her skin looks blue-grey as she looks at herself in the mirror and makes another mark next to her day count.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Is this what its like now? She rubs her soft stomach, shaking her head. In the mirror this grey thing with hair like a dead pine tree, blotchy skin, just waiting to erupt in a mound of pimples.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Her fingers tease her hair, slowly getting it to untangle enough for a comb as the daylight slowly gains confidence, as if it had been frightened by the nightmares, needed to see the courage of others to rise and be seen. She steps into the bathroom, washing her face, under her arms, and pulls on a pair of house shorts and a tank top.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the front room, next to the economy kitchen, there&#39;s a desk and four black chairs, two bookshelves. They&#39;d been left on the side of the road after a college kid realized they&#39;d never own another book or work on anything at home after graduation. She has two books, so far, but has drawn the room over and over at the call center she works: cat, cat tower by the widow, a whole wall of books and framed pictures of friends and pets and adventure. She&#39;s only 29, there&#39;s time for everything still.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Heaven isn&#39;t dead.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The laminate floor is cold and sticky under her feet, and she looks at the calendar on her desk and nearly kneels to the floor. Another day off. She almost wished she were still in the group home.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She steps into the kitchen, grabbing a plastic spoon and digging a mound of peanut butter up and slowly licking it as she slowly goes over meeting times and places, in need of someone, something.<br />
You do not want to abandon all this, job, plans. All this, the blank walls, the cold clammy floor, eating peanut butter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Her cell rings. She almost sends it to voicemail but somehow talking to a sales person seems a decent distraction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;Sofie, please, don&#39;t hang up. Its Elliot.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She sticks the spoon in her mouth, chewing on the peanut butter silently.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;Look, It&rsquo;s been a while and it was fucked up how it ended but I need help, alright? This guy hung himself off the bridge near the camp, and its fucked with me bad. He was just crazy, couldn&#39;t make the bits fit after his kid died or something, but its where I&#39;m headed, just some nameless dead fuck next to the river.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;Fuck you, Elliot.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She starts to end the call, &quot;Its the camp, they broke it up, the cops did, and the money&#39;s still there. Come on and meet me down at the bakery alright? I&#39;m looking decent even.&quot; She holds her thumb over the red end call button. &quot;Nothing to do with meth. I&#39;m clean. You won&#39;t be close to anything, okay? Just come on... And if you can bring me my clothes tha&mdash;&quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She just says &quot;Fine,&quot; and hangs up. She didn&#39;t want to help him, but she needed to be needed, and so far this was the only option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
---<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sofie looks over her shoulder before crossing the bike track, her loose grey shorts stick to her legs as she slogs along through the stiff riverside air. The camp is, of course, miles away from the bakery and the nature walk is hilly and mostly loose dirt track with deep water run off gouges in the surface.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Last time she came she&#39;d been high, the leaves had been a green fluorescence, and time hadn&#39;t existed. Now they keep the breeze off her back and keep the new born sun hidden away, like she&#39;d gotten to see the daylight for just an instant and now had to struggle back through this new twilight.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;Gods, this better be worth it.&quot; She takes a few steps up a moss-covered trail, beginning to doubt her sense of direction. The top of the incline shows her the old railroad bridge and around the signs of the camp. Under the track had been tents mostly, to the east a fire pit, and along the tree line other, later arrivals had set up shop. There are still a few collapsed tents and piles of trash and old clothing littering the cleared meadow next to the river. Some police tape flaps in the wind near the access to the bridge and, in some obscene memorial or mockery, little plastic baby dolls dangle from the branches of a spruce, their painted plastic eyes mostly staring at the bridge.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She had been ignoring the urge to turn back for a while. And while the trees had seemed tolerant, now they began to creak, a sudden breeze somewhere in the canopy, dead twigs began to clatter down and wake a few owls.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But, it was an awful lot of money.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She takes out her phone and opens the text message she&#39;d written to herself, follows Elliot&rsquo;s directions to a small clump of tall bushes. Under the rock is a small trowel to help dig, and after a few minutes on her knees, she pulls a pair of duffel bags out of the earth, and smells the stench of old money that had traded between junkies and strippers and dealers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;Why does this asshole want more shots of the bridge? Open and shut suicide. What the fuck.&quot; Sofie hadn&#39;t heard the truck door, but through the leaves she can see two plainclothes men with cameras around their necks.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
She waits, watching them take a few hurried shots of the bridge, ladder, and a long climb to take a few shots of the area near where he&#39;d been found hanging.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;... Dropped him into the damn river, clumsy volunteer couldn&#39;t handle the stench and just dropped.. &quot; She catches a bit of the conversation as the two head back towards their truck and turn their lights off.</span></span>
