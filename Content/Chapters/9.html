<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I wake screaming. Went to the doctor last month, and he told me it was anxiety. I think that&rsquo;s shit. What anxiety? I have written my books&mdash;all is finished, and in a way, so am I. This is what age will do to you.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ayn rolls over. Drool hangs from youthful lips. Hair poorly bleached, but the roots honest. My screams have barely stirred her. I remember when I could sleep like that. The rest of youth. When I was 22 and just made a mistake, I slept deeper too. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I strip my bedsheets and search the nightstand. I find thick, coke-bottled glasses and put them on. I stand and stick out my arm. The walls sturdy me as I drudge to my study. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Essays are piled on my bureau. I can taste their stench: the acid and ink. I could make a GA grade them, save me the migraine. But hopefully, I will be lucky. Maybe one will be good. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I next reach Ayn&rsquo;s. We agree on nothing. I do not suffer to read it but only scribble &ldquo;C&rdquo; on the top. She&rsquo;ll convince me to make it a &ldquo;B&rdquo; later.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dawn has come, and my cigarettes are low. In the kitchen cabinet, I grab a cigarette carton and the coffee tin beside it. I light one as I brew a pot. I should probably wake Ayn. Simone will be home soon.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I switch on the TV. Black and white. Never saw the need for color. Ronald Reagan is preaching about the War. I mutter, &ldquo;prick&rdquo;, over the cigarette clinging to my lips. I turn off the TV and walk the cold outside for the newspaper. The headline counts Allied losses.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Back in the bedroom, Ayn has risen. She asks if I would like to come back to bed. I say, &ldquo;Not today.&rdquo; She stands bare and walks to the bathroom, her skin prickling from cold. She stops, leans across the doorframe. She turns to me, running fingers through her trashy hair. This is the second attempt. My answer is the same, &ldquo;Not today.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I sit bedside and I hear her gurgle Listerine into the sink. I grab her dress from the floor. It is eggshell-colored with yellow embroidered flowers. I throw it at her when she reenters. She asks, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this for?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You need to go.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck you.&rdquo; She plays with her hair again, &ldquo;When will I see you again?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Soon.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I leave her to dress and return to the shitty essays in my study. After a minute, she slinks through the door. Her dress has a burgundy stain across the bust where I spilt wine last night. She reminds me, &ldquo;I want another dress, the same color&hellip; No, I&rsquo;ll take it in black.&rdquo; She then sits at the edge of my bureau and clicks open her clutch, taking a cigarette. I light it for her, and she takes a drag and asks, &ldquo;What happened to your glasses?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">She squints and asks, &ldquo;Are you that blind, love?&rdquo; She takes my glasses and turns them to me. Both lenses are fractured, segmented in three pieces like a delicately cut pie. How haven&rsquo;t I noticed? I feel embarrassed, but laugh gaily like a forgetful old man. She laughs too and places them back on my ears. She takes another drag and lifts her head high, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you new ones when you buy my dress. Oh, make it white as a wedding dress. I want to feel like a virgin&mdash;&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The windowpane behind me shatters. I fall to the floor, Ayn joining me. Blood pooling through her chest where the stain was. I reach to her, but she pushes away. She takes her hand to the wound and then to my chest. I am now stained too. She cries, &ldquo;Judgment&hellip;&rdquo; then cries no more. </span></span></p>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I lift my head. Bullets scream past my ears. I scuttle to my bedroom closet. Hide in its shallow corner. Listen to boots on hardwood. I dare not breathe.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Through the paneling, I see a solider, a perverse cross on his uniform. I know that cross from nightmares red and black. He reaches to the door and rips it open.</span></span>
