My name is Thomas. Yes, my name is Thomas, and my life is defined by tension, by the foreboding feeling my world is going to come crashing down on me. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever known a time when I was completely sure of one thing or another. And I&rsquo;ve certainly never known a moment when the peace the preacher talks about silences the mental violence that comes from my desire to understand. I&rsquo;m sure there are some who know that kind of peace. It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t. And I don&rsquo;t think I ever will.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That&rsquo;s one of the tensions I&rsquo;m talking about. I know I&rsquo;m supposed to experience this peace. The preacher says so. The Bible says so. But the fact is that for whatever reason, a war-torn country is more likely to experience peace than I am. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want this peace. I do. I really do. I run after it. I chase it. I pursue it. With every step, it seems the distance of my desire grows. Sometimes I wonder if God is playing a trick on me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Some say I&rsquo;ll grow out of it. At twenty‐one years old, I&rsquo;m subject to level headedness. They speak as if my head grows in levelness each year, thereby reducing the amount of tension I perceive&mdash;the amount I feel. It must be a funny math equation I don&rsquo;t understand, because months and years only seem to increase that tension. I could be wrong. We are talking about tension after all.<br />

I was born to a family that didn&rsquo;t want me. At least when I was born they didn&rsquo;t. An accident. A surprise, some would say. While my father cared for me well and even told me he loved me, there was always the tinge of doubt in his eye. The gaze of a father for his son is a beholding that causes the rest of the world to go silent. The type of gaze that promises profound rest. Yet, right when I thought I would receive this rest, the culmination of a father&rsquo;s love, something would disrupt the still silence. It was like his gaze was suddenly interrupted by a toy falling from a shelf in my room when all was meant to be frozen in the calm of his vision. The subtle tinge of doubt in his eye disrupted the rest and introduced the grand, &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; That &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; question created a chasm between us, or so I thought. <em>What if he hadn&rsquo;t had a kid as a freshman in college? And what if he hadn&rsquo;t had too much to drink that night? What if?</em> While my father&rsquo;s love was genuine, it existed in the tension of the &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; that occupied his mind even when he actively drove it out, even when he wasn&rsquo;t thinking about his life at all, even in the monotonous routine of work as a mid‐level employee at an average business in an average town.<br />

My mother never expected to have a child at the age of nineteen. After all, in the twentieth century, people wait to have children. Careers, while they may not be the be‐all‐end‐all of life, are certainly important. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to bring up a child in a world with no comfort, no financial security, and no college fund, <em>would you?</em> The tension my mother unknowingly communicated to me sprung from a deep and secret well in her heart. As a woman, the art of having a baby and raising a child fulfilled a desire in her soul. Yet, because of her context, the circumstances of my conception, she expressed to me constantly, non‐verbally of course, that she was a failure as a mother. She was somehow less qualified to be a mother and less successful. It was as if she could see all the physical needs I had as a human being but was too blinded by her own perceived failure to see what I needed as a person. With every touch, hug, kiss, and bedtime story, she subtly reinforced the fact that I was loved, but not with the same love as every other boy or girl I knew at school.<br />

These realities, mentalities, whatever you want to call them, constituted the foundation of my childhood. But it was so much more than my childhood. It was the primary relationship that formed the basis for every other relationship I would enter into. My parents were more than the progenitors of my life as a human being; they were the beginning of me as a person. My parents&rsquo; relationship haunts me. It creates all sorts of what if questions. Their relationship with me has irrevocably shaped me, not just as a human being but as a person. So, for me to talk about a life‐defining tension between unknown variables requires I talk about my father and my mother.<br />
<br />
I will never know if I am the only one to experience such an abstraction from their parents. I can&rsquo;t see the gaze another son sees in his father&rsquo;s eyes. That is reserved for them and them alone. Speculation, therefore, is not only unhelpful, but is also wrong. To barge in on such a sacred space would be to insert a third into a dance meant only for two, thereby throwing off the rhythm altogether. So, I&rsquo;m left to ponder the gaze my own father gave me, and the kiss of my mother. I&rsquo;m left to play the back and forth of being loved and wanting more, believing there&rsquo;s more. I&rsquo;m left with knowing about peace but never really experiencing it.<br />

This lack of experience actually created not the absence of experience, but something completely other, an experience contrary to what I&rsquo;d hoped to have as a son. Rather than being secure in the warm nest of a home, I was ripped from my expected comfort by the cold claw of the dream of what could have been for my parents. The clutch of this claw released me only to set me in this world of cycles, ups, and downs, fleeting joy and depression.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It&rsquo;s not so much that the cycles are inherently bad. I think most people probably know what I&rsquo;m talking about and can at least at some level admit to having a similar cyclical experience. It seems consistency could be the true sign of godliness. Those attaining to that mythological higher spiritual plane are those who are never wavering, never faltering in the whirlwind of shifting circumstance. These are the ones who stare into the future with a stone‐like demeanor, a cold, hard jaw line and fierce determination that nothing will destroy the never‐ending experience with the divine they enjoy, unlike the majority of the faithless and weak population. I&rsquo;ve never met anyone like this. My mind says they don&rsquo;t exist. My heart prays my mind&rsquo;s assessment is correct.<br />

My name is Thomas. Yes, my name is Thomas, and I&rsquo;ve become convinced the answer to this tension is not a resolution of the tension itself. Currently, I sit in a room at the Greene Counseling Center under suicide watch. In a moment of counterfeit bliss, I swung low, but not quite fast enough. The result was nothing to show but a grotesque bruise, not as a scarlet letter, but a blackened spot reflecting my plague.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It had been a nice day. The campus was alive and I could actually hear the normal noise of student life in the quad outside my dormitory. My roommate had gone to see a girl he&rsquo;d been dating. Apparently, his errand was not nearly as time consuming as I had originally expected. He was the one who found me. Limp. Lifeless. Face expressing the same weariness I had before. That&rsquo;s why I say, &ldquo;Counterfeit bliss.&rdquo; Even in that moment of near death, the reality of the tension I know so well could not be erased from the way my mouth could never quite smile, and the deep sorrow expressed in sunken eyes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Uncertainty, like breathing, eating, and sleeping, has become part of my daily sustenance. I&rsquo;ve never considered myself a writer, but sitting in a room isolated, which is ironic for suicide watch, has a way of inspiring a contemplation. I think it&rsquo;s the sterility of this place. I&rsquo;m approached as if my despair was a contagion waiting to spread and wipe out the happiness of the entire populace. The sterility, the isolation has a way of creating a craving for nearness, for friendship. Or, at least the incomplete manifestations of nearness and friendship I knew before my first death. That life seems like an eternity ago.<br />

So, I write. I write for a companion. I write to remember. I write to find an escape. I write because white walls, white uniforms and white, non‐slip shoes break from white&rsquo;s archetypal meaning of purity and perfection. I&rsquo;m surrounded by white precisely because I&rsquo;m not perfect; I&rsquo;m not pure. I don&rsquo;t know what form all of this will take or if anyone will ever read it. But, I write because this story demands to be told. I write, because more than anything, I need to find hope.</span></span>
