<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Addie go deep!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You it threw too far!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I told you to go long.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Throw it to me!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Addie Mae Collins took Janie&rsquo;s purse and tossed it to Sarah. The purse was oddly shaped like a football, and they had thrown it the length of their trek: the sisters&rsquo; weekly adventure to Sixteenth Street. Their adventure usually lasted twenty minutes, but this morning they were late. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Earlier that morning, Addie, a quiet child, argued savagely with their eldest sister Junie. Junie had borrowed Addie&rsquo;s ring for the school dance, and when Addie asked back for it that morning Junie said it was <em>misplaced</em> and she would find it later. Addie knew what that meant, as do all little poor girls. It was lost. A priceless gift, given by her mother, was lost. Addie and Junie shouted at one another until Junie, feeling both guilt and anger, deserted her sisters to ride the bus. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Janie, the second oldest, thought her purse would distract Addie. Its contents rattled, battering against the sidewalk as the girls dropped it. Janie knew a broken bottle of mascara was worth her sister&rsquo;s happiness. Their twenty-minute walk became forty-five. They were sweating as they reached the church. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Whew, hand that back over.&rdquo; Sarah snapped the purse back to Janie, and Janie caught it and ran into the basement with other two following hotly behind. &ldquo;Look at us. We&rsquo;re a mess. Addie, you&rsquo;re all sweaty, and look at your hair, Sarah. Your braids are lopsided.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They ran into the washroom, taking napkins to dry their sweat. Addie took Sarah&rsquo;s braids and started straightening them. &ldquo;Janie, this is going take awhile. You go ahead.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, but make sure that when you get done you go upstairs. Because we&rsquo;re already late, and we don&rsquo;t want to get any later.&rdquo; She swung the door open, revealing Denise McNair. &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Good morning to you.&rdquo; Denise entered the washroom with a borrowed comb, compact, and quarter. Her mother wouldn&rsquo;t allow makeup in church, so when her mother shuffled upstairs to the choir loft she went to the basement to find her Aunt Helen. &ldquo;Aunt Helen, can I borrow your comb, your compact, and a quarter?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Does your mother want you to have any of that?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Aunt Helen, who didn&rsquo;t mind her niece wearing makeup in church, gave it to her. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Janie released the door behind Denise and went to the sanctuary. The washroom was small with only one stall, sink and mirror, but traffic often flooded through. It was not unusual to have six or seven young girls there at once. Denise McNair started prettying herself before the mirror, talking when her face wasn&rsquo;t stilled. &ldquo;Glad to know Momma and I aren&rsquo;t the only ones late. We stayed at my aunt&rsquo;s last night.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your Aunt Helen?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s here, but guess what? It&rsquo;s my birthday! Eleven. How old are you two?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Fourteen.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Twelve.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Huh&hellip; I thought I was as old as Sarah. But anyway, my aunt bought me just the cutest doll! She gave it to me last night. It&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door swung open, and Carole Robertson saw the others fixing themselves. A minute before, Carole had excused herself from class to use the toilet but had no intention of using it. On her feet were the first pair of heels she had ever worn. Their luxuriant blackness contrasted sharply with her glowing white dress. She felt beautiful. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She went to the mirror and saw the beauty she felt. A strand of hair dangled loosely on her brow, so she smoothed it in place and smiled into the mirror when she was done. Only then did she realize her impoliteness. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Denise used the greeting as an excuse to speak. &ldquo;Hey, guess what?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birthday.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, good for you. Happy birthday!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Denise continued rapidly about her birthday and doll. Carole moved to help Addie with Sarah&rsquo;s braids. Cynthia Wesley entered. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There was excitement in Cynthia. It was the monthly youth day service, and she was chosen as an usher; however, the morning had not gone as she planned. She had spent the night with her friend Shirley, and was chastised by Shirley&rsquo;s mother that morning for her slip peaking beneath her dress. Shirley&rsquo;s mother cried, &ldquo;Young lady, your slip is hanging below your dress. You just don&rsquo;t put your clothes on anyway when you go to church, because you never know how you are coming back.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cynthia pushed to the washroom&rsquo;s mirror and inspected her slip and dress and breathed a sigh of relief when both were fine. She then asked, &ldquo;Whose birthday is it?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, happy birthday. How old are you?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Eleven!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Only three more years before you get old, like me.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Cynthia, you&rsquo;re not old!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, because I sure feel it,&rdquo; she said with a face that immediately crumbled into laughter.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sounding like your daddy.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s funny.&rdquo; Cynthia paused and became serious. &ldquo;We need to get upstairs to help with the service.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They all agreed, but before they left Denise asked, &ldquo;Before we go, Addie Mae, will you help me tie my sash?&rdquo; Addie stood from Sarah&rsquo;s tightly braided hair and began tying the sash.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>There are moments wounded in time. Forty years later, a wisp on eternity&rsquo;s breath, Sarah Collins Rudolph describes the next few seconds</em><strong>, &ldquo;</strong>All of a sudden, I heard a loud sound -- BOOM! -- and I was blind in both my eyes. Glass blinded both of them. Then I shouted out, &#39;ADDIE! ADDIE! ADDIE!&#39;&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The floor quaked. Walls shuddered. Voices hailed in the chaos: </span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&ldquo;My baby, my baby!&rdquo; </span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did Sputnik hit us?&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Everybody calm down!&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Janie lifted her head from the carpet. The sanctuary was dim, the elements of Christ scattered to the floor. Lifting herself, she pushed through the aisles looking for her sisters and found Junie. They wept, each losing herself in the other&rsquo;s embracing arms, but a voice punched through the madness, &ldquo;It came from the basement!&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Janie pushed Junie back, &ldquo;Where are Addie and Sarah?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t they with you?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Janie turned to the basement door that she had walked through only a minute before when the world was safer. She screamed, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and sprinted back to it, but the blast had destroyed the stairs leading down. Black ash and voices rose from the opening. She turned to Junie, who had run after her. Already knowing the answer, Junie asked, &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I left them down there, Junie. I left them down there! I told them to hurry!&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"> &nbsp;</span></span>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the surrounding blocks, optimistic men asked if they heard thunder. Underneath the sacred rubble laid five girls, four dead&mdash;Sarah, the only one left alive. Her hair again a mess. The coward&rsquo;s only warning was, &ldquo;Three minutes.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what he said when a fourteen-year-old named Carolyn answered the church phone.</span></span></p>
