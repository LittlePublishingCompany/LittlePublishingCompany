<p><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)">&nbsp; &nbsp; It truly is a wild world which we have stumbled upon while&nbsp;hunting for&nbsp;confimration&nbsp;of the Lone Wanderer, a&nbsp;legend that has spread throughout our lands. It is little wonder&nbsp;we have so little understanding of what actually occurred here. This place operates on a certain level of chaos&nbsp;I believe few could ever hope to comprehend. Giant beasts descend upon the erected structures&nbsp;all with a strength and speed that our&nbsp;carriages&nbsp;could scarce&nbsp;hope to achieve, and certainly not to such glorious effect.&nbsp;Meanwhile, those who dwell within act extremely peculiar,&nbsp;often gathering near one another&nbsp;yet rarely engaging in any meaningful manor. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily, following the hints of handed down stories, we have found the writing&nbsp;this supposed Lone Wanderer&nbsp;left behind. Though we seem to be currently&nbsp;missing the early stages of his journey, we hope&nbsp;what we send back offers&nbsp;truth of what happened in this fabled story. We shall stay, if only to see what else we can uncover, and see if any sense can be made of this mystical land.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp; I find myself in a strange land seeking comfort after being abandoned by those who have wings. The mad ravings of the angry ones have driven me from my native land of Terminal B, and I have forged a new path. One of the angry ones said I skipped her in line to foster grace with those who have wings. I didn&#39;t, but even if I did, so what... she was weak. Still, the angry ones are together, and I am alone. Therefore I must away.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After not having consumed for many hours, I hear a whisper of sustenance and go searching. I have found it, a temporary haven amidst the chaos. There are others like me, lost and alone. Some small comfort. But this place offers no shelter or shadow, and soon I must seek sanctuary elsewhere. Here&#39;s hoping for better hours ahead.</span></span></p>
