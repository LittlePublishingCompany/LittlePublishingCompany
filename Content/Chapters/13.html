<div><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Jacky, you better put that out right now.&rdquo; I look over to see Lilly standing in the hallway, clearly upset with me smoking out the window.</span></span></div>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&mdash;uh&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;You&mdash;uh what?&rdquo; She&rsquo;s waiting to laugh at whatever excuse I might come up with.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding it for a friend?&rdquo; I give her the cheesiest, most sardonic smile I can muster.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought you were going to quit, Jacky,&rdquo; she strolls over to me; I flick the half smoked cigarette onto the street below. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d stop smoking, at least until after the baby gets here.&rdquo; Her hands automatically go to her belly as a smile spreads across her face at the mere mention of the word &ldquo;baby&rdquo;. I smile along with her. I&rsquo;ve never been more excited for anything in my life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Last one. Swear,&rdquo; I say closer and wrapping my arms around her, &ldquo;This time&rsquo;s for real.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Just remember,&rdquo; her smile shifts to a cold glare, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; lifting her finger to my neck, &ldquo;I will cut you while you sleep,&rdquo; forming a slicing motion across my carotid as she transitions back to her previous smile. &ldquo;Mmkay pumpkin?&rdquo; She makes a slightly terrifying cackle as she turns around and hurries to the door, &ldquo;Now come one, we&rsquo;re going to be late to our doctors appointment!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The doctor lathered that strange translucent goo on Lilly&rsquo;s belly before moving the ultrasound across her belly. &ldquo;Is this your first?&rdquo; she asked, seeming almost interested. I can&rsquo;t possibly fathom how she could be though, with the amount of expectant mothers she must see. At this point it must be an automated response.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; the excitement in Lilly&rsquo;s voice can barely contain how proud she is to be a mom.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Would you like to know the gender or would you&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes! Gender!&rdquo; Lilly&rsquo;s excitement gets the best of her. Realizing that we haven&rsquo;t talked about it, she looks to me, &ldquo;I mean, we want to know right?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Well, actually--&rdquo; The death stare strikes, slicing through me, &ldquo;Joking! We would love to know doctor.&rdquo; I slip my hand into Lilly&rsquo;s as the doctor studies the screen carefully. I really don&rsquo;t care either way, so I&rsquo;m not sure why I&rsquo;m so nervous. Lilly squeezes my hand.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; the doctor proclaims. Even though I didn&rsquo;t know until she told us, I&rsquo;m relieved that we&rsquo;re having a boy. I would have no idea how to raise a little girl, not that I know much more about raising a son.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure this isn&rsquo;t too blue?&rdquo; Lilly&rsquo;s worried our son will come out criticizing everything that we&rsquo;ve prepared for him.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Honestly honey, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll notice.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jack, this is serious. All of the parenting books say to welcome him with soft gentle tones.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Lilly, the blue is fine. Can&rsquo;t you already feel its tranquility?&rdquo; I pause to close my eyes and take a very exaggerated breath, &ldquo;See? I&rsquo;m feeling at peace already. Wow, this room is magical!&rdquo; Her un-amused expression is vocal enough. &ldquo;Does a newborn really need all of this stuff? I mean he won&rsquo;t be able to use anything in this room for like two years. Do you think you went a bit overboard?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jacky, we&rsquo;re about to be parents, we need to be ready for anything. Aren&rsquo;t you the least bit concerned? Have you even thought about how far in over our heads we are? We are about to be in charge of another living being. This isn&rsquo;t just about you and me anymore. We need to think about our son. We need to think about the future.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I feel a bit embarrassed. How can she be so much better at this than I am? Where did she learn all of this stuff? Why am I not thinking about any of this? I need to clear my head.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you going, Jack?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I need some fresh air, I&rsquo;m going for a walk.&rdquo; I hear her crying as I leave.</span></span>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">***</span></span></div>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Angry Catfish is among the late night bars that never seem to close. I walk in and take what has become my usual spot at the bar. Jessie is tending the bar as usual; she&rsquo;s young, cute, basically everything you expect in a downtown bartender.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jacky, what are ya havin&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Scotch on the rocks, and Jessie, I don&rsquo;t feel like seeing the bottom tonight.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Is everything alright, Jacky?&rdquo; She almost sounds concerned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, you come in here almost every night alone, carrying such a sadn&mdash;&ldquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Scotch. Rocks.&rdquo; I look into her eyes. I want to be left alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tha boss.&rdquo; She pours my drink and walks to the opposite end of the bar. I hate small talk. I just want to sit and enjoy a few drinks in the smoky quiet.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo; </span></span>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">***</span></span></div>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sitting on the floor of our son&rsquo;s nursery, I attempt to assemble this godforsaken contraption that society calls a crib. Why did we choose to get one from IKEA? Why couldn&rsquo;t we just find one pre-assembled? These directions don&rsquo;t even make sense!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; I hear Lilly shriek from the kitchen, &ldquo;JACK!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Frantically, I jump to my feet racing into the kitchen. Lilly trembling on the floor, cowering against the counter, clutching her stomach. A small pool of blood has collected around her feet. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong Jack, something&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My God, what the hell do I do!? Lilly&hellip; what the hell is happening?!&rdquo; Everything around me is spinning; I grab the counter to steady myself. I have to be strong; Lilly needs me to be strong.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s going to be fine,&rdquo; I try to reassure her, but I can&rsquo;t even reassure myself. I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s wrong with her, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just head over to the hospital and they can take a look, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m lying through my teeth. We both know it, yet we continue to play along, lying to ourselves in order to keep going. As we near the car, she keels forward with anguish. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost to the car Lil, just a bit further.&rdquo; My voice trembles, the will to maintain any rationality rapidly fading.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lilly cries out the entire drive. She grips at her stomach. We race through the streets.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there Lil, hold on. Just hold on!&rdquo; My knuckles whiten. I can&rsquo;t possibly grip the wheel any tighter than they already are.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As we pull into the E.R. I jump out and wave down a nearby paramedic. I try to explain the situation, but I&rsquo;m so terrified I can&rsquo;t form a complete sentence, &ldquo;My wife, she&rsquo;s pregnant!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lilly screams from inside the car, warranting the paramedics to rush a stretcher and place her on it. Running behind them, I plead for answers, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with her!? Is it the baby!? Are they going to be okay!? Will someone please fucking answer me?!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the paramedics turns to face me, holding me back as they rush her through a set of sliding doors. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening to my wife?!&rdquo; Screaming into his face I grab his shoulders, attempting to throw him aside so I can be with Lilly. Instead he pulls me in for a firm embrace. &ldquo;I just want to know what&rsquo;s happening!&rdquo; Now, I am sobbing into his shoulders as he stands firm, holding me up.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sir, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong, but I promise you that the doctors will do everything they possibly can to help your wife and child.&rdquo; I have never felt more impotent. &ldquo;Sir, I need you to take a deep breath and calm down. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; His grasp tightens as I frivolously attempt to break free.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;J&mdash;Jack. My name&hellip; is Jack.&rdquo; Tears stream steadily down my face; I choke, rasping for oxygen. How can he be so calm right now? Lilly could be dying! And I&rsquo;m stranded here far from her side.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay Jack, I need you to take some slow, steady breaths for me. Can you do that?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s speaking to me as if I&rsquo;m an infant. I don&rsquo;t have enough energy to muster the words &ldquo;shut the hell up&rdquo;-- I sputter even attempting. &ldquo;Slow, steady breaths Jack. That&rsquo;s it, just breath.&rdquo; I continue to struggle for breath, attempting to regain control. &ldquo;Breathe Jack... Okay, now can you tell me your wife&rsquo;s name, Jack?&rdquo; He keeps repeating my name over and over, it&rsquo;s so irritating that I want to knock his fucking teeth loose. He should be doing everything possible to help Lilly right now! And this&hellip; This! This is not helping!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Lilly. Her name&hellip; is&hellip; Lilly.&rdquo; The large gasps of oxygen are becoming farther apart, but my heart still is beating loudly inside my head.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Listen to me Jack, Lilly is in the best possible hands the hospital has to offer. I&rsquo;m going to let go now, okay?&rdquo; I slowly nod my head that is still buried into his shoulder. The pressure of his hold gradually subsides as he continues to monitor me, making sure I don&#39;t hurdle through the sliding doors. &ldquo;Okay, Jack now I need you to walk me through exactly what happened.&rdquo;</span></span>
