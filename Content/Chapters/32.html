<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">The boy bicycles home in wintry dusk. His forehead scarlet, mended hand stiff. He waves at Avery as he passes. Avery waves back then continues wrapping his roses. Coldsnap is early, first week of November.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He walks in, and Nana is on the phone, straightening its spiral cord with her thumb. She covers the receiver and tells him, &ldquo;Go on back and play with Sister.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got homework.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then do that first.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nana agrees with the phone, and the boy empties his backpack on the kitchentable among his father&rsquo;s tomes. Nana covers the receiver again, &ldquo;Thought I told ya to go back to y&rsquo;alls bedroom?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a table back there.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then do it on the floor. I&rsquo;ll let you know when you and Sister can come up.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy takes his book and folder and goes back. Sister pretends to be asleep when he walks in. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo; She lies still beneath her unicorn comforter. He sits on the converted washroom&rsquo;s plaid linoleum and opens his book.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister sits up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no fun.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Am too.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister sits beside him on the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored. Nana won&rsquo;t let me go outside&mdash;says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too cold&rdquo;&mdash;she won&rsquo;t let me watch the television either. Whatcha readin&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>The Giver.</em>&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hard to say. It&rsquo;s mostly about this boy and old man remembering things that other people can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you read it to me?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy pities her and reads aloud for a few minutes then stops. Sister asks why, and he answers that he needs a pencil.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nana is agreeing with the phone again as he slips nto the kitchen: &ldquo;Somethun&rsquo;s got to be done. On Halloween, he and that sissy were handin&rsquo; candy to kids, and that ain&rsquo;t right. It&rsquo;s a sin I tell you. Two sins, infact.&rdquo; She hears the boy and covers the receiver, &ldquo;Boy, get back to ya room before I burn your hide!&rdquo; She mutters loud enough for the boy to hear, &ldquo;Just like his daddy and that bastard before him,&rdquo; before returning to the phone.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The martins have long flown. Rain streams from Christmas lights on Avery&rsquo;s frontporch, evangelizing radiance an inch until sliding into pooled darkness. The boy plays <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Calvin and Sister watch.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How many times have you beaten it?&rdquo; The boy answers four. Calvin whispers, &ldquo;Goddammed, you need a new game.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister starts, but the boy interrupts her, &ldquo;The truce.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calvin asks, &ldquo;What truce?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can cuss, but ever time you do I have to read a page to Sister.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So if I cuss alot&mdash;&ldquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll read alot. Then punch you for it.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister slackens into the den&rsquo;s couch. Her lips pulling an uneven weight like her father&rsquo;s when satisfied.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hours pass. Calvin whispers at the television, &ldquo;Kill that asshole!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister adds, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s thirteen.&rdquo; The boy glares at Calvin, frogs him on the bicep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Goddamit!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister snorts, &ldquo;Fourteen,&rdquo; and the boy draws back again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calvin surrenders his hands, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last. I swear.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy drops his fist, &ldquo;Better be. I&rsquo;m surprised Nana didn&rsquo;t hear ya.&rdquo; The boy presses pause. &ldquo;When&rsquo;s the last time y&rsquo;all heard her?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They search for Nana. Calvin and the boy wonder if she&rsquo;s playing Santa. Sister says Santa is real. The boy reasons with Sister, &ldquo;She can play Santa, and there still be a real one. It&rsquo;s like that Santa you see in the mall. He&rsquo;s not the real Santa but just playing Santa.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calvin groans, &ldquo;Why we lookin&rsquo; for ya Nana anyways? We only got so much break and momma&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to get me tomorrow night. Then I won&rsquo;t see y&rsquo;all &lsquo;til&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a pound at the frontdoor. Sister asks, &ldquo;You think its Nana playing Santa?&rdquo; The boy mutters no and looks through the door&rsquo;s peek. It&rsquo;s Avery&rsquo;s friend, Joe. His pastel cashmere is colored deeply with rain, pisses a halo round him. He&rsquo;s shivering, panicked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy opens the door, widens his chest. Joe questions, &ldquo;Have you seen Avery?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy shakes his head.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I use your phone? Something&rsquo;s happened to ours.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy gates open, points to a trimline mounted on the kitchen wall. Joe asks the children to close the door. He calls Gulf City Hospital then the county police. Only has been twelve hours, can&rsquo;t file a report. Rain lakes round his sodden loafers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thanks the children for the phone. A tear wells at his eye.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy asks him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe smears his cheek with a sleeve, forces a limp smile. &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo; He opens the door. Across the St. Augustine and Japgrass, a suited young man perches forward in Avery&rsquo;s porchswing, relieving the paisley around his neck. A Winchester straddles his knees. A mended cat curls at his feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the boy&rsquo;s father.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe crosses the road with high hands. The father waves them down but keeps a flat palm at the boy, charging him to stay. Joe yells, &ldquo;Do you know where he is?&rdquo; The father yells back, tells Joe to come beneath the awning. Their next words are inaudible.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn this,&rdquo; the boy vows, and he tears across the road. The father stands when he sees his son, calls the boy to return. But the boy&rsquo;s devotion betrays him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you to stay!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy shakes head, &ldquo;No. Something&rsquo;s wrong, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father threatens, &ldquo;Go back home this instant&mdash;&ldquo; but his rebuke drowns. Trundling the blacktop, two pickups turn down the gutted road. A Chevy leading a F-100 with dampened headlights. They dale treadmarks in the lawn, reddirt and Japgrass cambered wetly beneath pitiless tires. The F-100&rsquo;s mirrors are gone. Bat sized holes wrought through the headlights. Through a cleft windshield, the father sees Avery in the passenger seat. One of his eyes is beaten shut.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five men in canvas jackets egress into the downpour, gasoline in their hands. The father steps before Joe and the boy. One of the men shouts, &ldquo;Charlie, what you doin&rsquo; with that rifle?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Bill. What am I doing?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill spits.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father shouts, &ldquo;What are you planning with those cans? You can&rsquo;t burn the house in a downpour like this.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I reckon with e&rsquo;nough gasoline I can. You get you and ya boy off that porch.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father reaches inside his coat pocket, shows a ball blooded with his son&rsquo;s fingertips and sends it at Bill. Bill doubles, seizes his contused arm&mdash;his dropped can contributes to the flood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Goddam you, Charlie!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father raises his rifle, &ldquo;Bill, you let that man out his truck, and y&rsquo;all get on.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t do such a&mdash;&ldquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Winchester busts the Chevy&rsquo;s windshield. The father aims at Bill, &ldquo;Come again?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the men opens the F-100, throws Avery to the mud. Bill yells, &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t right. You goin&rsquo; against family.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, let <em>her</em> speak to me. Now get.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men pile in the Chevy and speed on. Joe ministers to Avery in the downpour. The father puts his hand on his son&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;Augie?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy answers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s help these men.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you going to shoot Mr. Bill?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father chambers the rifle, pulls a hapless trigger. &ldquo;Not without bullets.&rdquo;</span></span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</span></span></div>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"> &nbsp;<br />
The father spends the night on Avery&rsquo;s floorboards. He doesn&rsquo;t sleep. At sunrise, he returns across the road. Nana opens the door, &ldquo;Get you and these children out of my house and don&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shoves his way past her. He calls the children and on the kitchentable he opens a lawbook. Cut inside is a stamp and checkbook. He puts them in his pocket. Sister and the boy emerge, rubbing sleep from restive eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Calvin?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nana scowls. &ldquo;I sent him home.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father searches over his children. &ldquo;Get your shoes and coats.&rdquo; They pass stockings and a Leyland Cypress with presents that will never be opened. They put on their shoes silently. The boy helps Sister into her coat. When they return, the father holds out his hand. They take it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family strides across the road. Wet Japgrass kisses the boys canvas shoes. This is what they call home.</span></span><br />
