<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">I&rsquo;ve often pondered the anatomy of fear. What is it? What constitutes this thing which serves, sometimes in a comical, sometimes serious, as an icebreaker &ndash; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your greatest fear?&rdquo; A question posed half‐heartedly to a crowd of strangers, expecting that at the end of the conversation they&rsquo;ll at least be somewhat comfortable with one another. What is it that makes up this thing fear? Is it a substance? Is it a being, a creature that stalks humanity from the recesses of their doubts?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It&rsquo;s funny to think the question as common as &ldquo;What is your greatest fear?&rdquo; is never one that someone answers with a simple, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; The very nature a question like this can be posed to a group of people, with the expectation everyone will answer, says something about humans. Everyone fears. Or, fear has a hold of everyone. No exceptions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The tension I&rsquo;ve set out to define, delineate, explain and become okay with is seen quite clearly in the contemplation of my own fear. The universality of fear is both a comfort and a source of fear itself. It comforts me in a very unique way. In, at the very least, some abstract way, I can affirm I&rsquo;m not the only one feeling what I feel, battling what I&rsquo;m battling. I know I&rsquo;m not the only one afraid; I&rsquo;m not the only one who fear has decided to accompany throughout life. Taking stock of my current situation, my circumstances, I know the steps between me and someone else out in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world, the world of color and traffic and natural light, aren&rsquo;t that many. It would be relatively easy for someone to be where I am. Fear&rsquo;s what helps people take those fateful steps, I think.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While there&rsquo;s comfort in uniformity, I think most people want some instance of extreme uniqueness. They want to experience something that no one else has. They want to be the only one that has ever accomplished some great feat, or has exclusively witnessed a beautiful thing. However, this desire seems only to manifest itself in things and experiences people deem to be good, or acceptable, or noteworthy. It never applies to the negative side of things. No one wants to say he holds the most irrational fears. In fact, when it comes to things being negative, no one wants to be an individual.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
No one wants to feel like they&rsquo;re alone &ndash; when it comes to the unmentionable, frightening things. When individuality and feeling isolated are one in the same. Blazing forward in extreme individuality and uniqueness is only desirable when the sailing is good, and the path is clear, when people are cheering you on every step of the way. When the wind picks up ever so slightly with what might be a storm on the horizon, we cry out, &ldquo;Someone! Come to me! Help!&rdquo; and when no one answers, our cries become much more faint, &ldquo;Anyone . . . ?&rdquo; Slowly but surely all cries for help cease, and what once was a man is reduced to a shade, a shadow of what once was. This creature called fear lives and breathes at the arbitrary and cruel will of the taskmaster of uncertainty. The mind deprived of any real thought, the heart deprived of any real love, and the body deprived of any real living, the whole person becoming a trinity of irrationality, apathy, and languor.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
No one wants to realize the thing that cripples him is child&rsquo;s play for everyone else. People shudder at the idea of their fear being considered, of all things &ndash; unique. The fear of being the one only who is afraid is a powerful thing, a terrifying thing. That sort of fear silences the whispers and horrors of any other. I&rsquo;ll keep my fears so long as I&rsquo;m not the only who has them. This is the grand, supreme fear.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suppose, I still haven&rsquo;t answered the question of what fear is. A fact most easily explained with one simple phrase &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s quite more than a mere emotion. An emotion can be countered, ignored or dismissed. Fear, more often than not, is unconquerable. Some fears stay with a man his whole life; he is constantly engaged by it, like a second shadow. A simple emotion holds no real power over the resolute, and rational mind. Then again, it also seems quite ridiculous to explain fear as a real life being that stalks all of humanity, or even a host of beings that answer to the collective name of fear, much like Legion.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I think most know fear has to be more than just an emotion. They also know fear isn&rsquo;t a person haunting the houses of their hearts. Whatever it is, it is with me. I know it. I experience and feel fear as if it were the most intense emotion possible. And I know fear as if he were a man; a man that&rsquo;s been present in my life from the beginning. I know fear as if he were present at every major junction of life, tinting my life with a shade of caution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regardless of all my pondering of this thing called fear, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that much of what I feel, experience or know revolves around fear. It&rsquo;s as if I were afraid of this creature coming into my life and robbing me of my ability to feel anything at all. He would rob me of my ability to know the joy as well as the sorrow of life. In essence, I felt as if I were going to be robbed of my ability to be human. So what did I do? How did I appease this creature that would rob me of my soul? I did the only thing I knew to do. I tried to trump it. I tried to out‐do fear.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At this point, I don&rsquo;t even remember what exactly I was thinking about that overwhelmed me with such deep melancholy. Perhaps, I was listening to music when it all happened. In fact, I&rsquo;m sure I was. It wasn&rsquo;t a happy song. That I can assure you of. In listening and thinking a great wave of emotion crashes in on me, overwhelming the senses. I&rsquo;m no stranger to moments like these, and in fact, I like moments like these. It&rsquo;s a strange form of thrill seeking I suppose. In that moment, in many ways, I feel more alive than any other. It&rsquo;s as if all other things in life are mere replications of some pure thing floating around in the ether, just waiting to be grabbed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Between the music and profound feelings, a fear greater than all those creeps in. What if this is all there is? What if nothing greater than this fleeting moment exists? Not only that, what if I&rsquo;m never to experience anything like this again?<br />

One of the stories I always heard at church was about how God rescues the Israelites from Egypt by leading them through the Red Sea. He strikes Egypt with several terrible plagues and Pharaoh eventually lets the Israelites, his slaves, leave. However, Moses takes them not through the safe route but towards a sea with no easy out. Pharaoh, realizing he&rsquo;s let his workforce, his means of making Egypt great, free, in anger pursues them with his army.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The type of despair I&rsquo;m describing, the overwhelming fear, that&rsquo;s what I imagine the Israelites feel in the story, standing on the banks of the Red Sea with nowhere to run and one of the greatest armies the world has ever known chasing them. I can imagine how big the dust cloud would have been from the Egyptian army.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The story ends well. Moses stretches out his arms and the Red Sea parts. Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water simply part, leaving a path of dry ground for the Israelites to cross. When the Egyptians try to follow, the water crashes in, destroying them utterly. That&rsquo;s a word almost exclusively used in the Bible but what most aptly describes me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many years later when Egypt and the Red Sea was just a faint memory in the minds of most of the Israelites, someone else wrote about the story. He wrote a song. More than likely it&rsquo;s one I would listen to in one of those chasing emotion moments. He writes about the scene with the Israelites crossing through the Red Sea; yet, he doesn&rsquo;t see himself as an Israelite.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He&rsquo;s an Egyptian.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He talks of deep calling to deep, picturing the fragile walls of water crashing down upon him, destroying him, a child of Abraham, confused and self-identifying as an enemy.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More than the story of the Israelites escaping, the song of this man resonates deeply in my heart. Without actually putting words to his fear, I know exactly what he&rsquo;s talking about. I know the feeling of thinking that any moment the walls of the world are to come crashing in, on top of me, destroying me, washing me away, erasing any sign of my existence.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Only fear could take a story that was meant to inspire a people to hope in something and turn it into a metaphor for deep, aching, aloneness. Only fear could take someone who was meant to be the beneficiary of a promise and make him feel as if he were the recipient of a curse. I know that feeling. I know it well.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This brings together two fears, facing off in my soul. The fear of death and the fear of living collided in one fateful moment and the fear of death lost. In that moment, which was scored by some introspective limerick, the fear of remaining alive outmatched death and his all his host of uncertainty. In a simple vertical motion, I gave death the chance to outwit his opponent; I gave him the chance to prove, while maybe less daunting, he was certainly the more powerful of the two. As my eyes closed to a squint, the room closing in, and light retreating, Death appeared to have struck a fatal blow. Fear would no longer reside as the foci of my life. I bartered with Death; the agreement required I give in and he would clean house in a permanent way &ndash; fear would no longer take up residence in my heart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In that moment it was if the world had frozen. My new business partner cheaply mimicked the stillness the gaze of my father was meant to produce. He stepped in, forbidding any movements not allowed by our agreement. He no longer asked if I&rsquo;d like to talk, he no longer asked of me my friendship as he had before when such a chain of events nagged in the back of my head. Rather, Death came in and demanded my simple obedience. I had no other option. The tone of his voice and the touch of his hand shifted from that of a friend‐to‐be or a would‐be lover to the taskmaster I knew him to be all along. Standing behind him, smiling cruelly, I saw Fear. I knew I&rsquo;d chosen wrongly. I knew I&rsquo;d gotten it all wrong.</span></span>
