&nbsp; &nbsp; I stretched myself out on the grass beside the Holiday Inn Express. Crossing my legs and stretching out my arms, I tried to imagine what Jesus felt as the nails dug into his body. I swallowed, feeling the sharp pain as a chip of my tooth slid down my throat, gone forever. It wasn&rsquo;t the taste of bitter wine, but stale beer that filled my mouth. My head began to ache a bit, but that was to be expected, on account of just having the shit beat out of me by my brother. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The argument that started the fight centered on Iconography. It happened that my brother had a degree in art history, and took umbrage that I had brought an Icon of Christ with me for my evening prayers while in Iowa for the funeral. He was a thin man then, at the age of indecision. That is to say, he&rsquo;d drunk away most of his twenties, found himself with a pregnant girlfriend, and had to figure out in a right damn hurry &ldquo;how to adult&rdquo;. The final straw came when the discussion turned to women. My brother contended that due and proper veneration of the Virgin Mary began at the Council of Chalcedon, whereas I was certain that the veneration of Mary was confirmed as early as the Nicene Council.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We were, of course, drunk at the time. But that was expected, with my grandpa&rsquo;s funeral being earlier that day, and having to make nice with the relatives. Some families have family reunions; it takes a corpse or two to bring my father&rsquo;s side together, as the folks are fairly split between the Christian nuts, who won&rsquo;t talk to you because you&rsquo;re sinful and wrong, and the progressive agnostics, who won&rsquo;t talk to you because you&rsquo;re close-minded and uninformed. As it turns out, I&rsquo;m more in the former camp, and my brother in the latter.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; By this point, my head was beginning to swell right proper. I prayed my brother would help me soon. See, from what I understood about fighting, two brothers clear the air by thwacking each other a few times, and then through the mystifying biochemistry of the masculine psyche, return as friends with a newfound love and respect for each other. Unfortunately, my theory went awry, on account of my brother being an asshole. After he sucker punched me, knocking my glasses off, he proceeded to deliver several blows to my face. Having become aware that all rules of engagement were off, I proceeded into the fail-safe battle strategy of all men who share my height and girth: I bowled my brother over and sat on him. I forced his arms out and nailed them down with my knees. I crossed his thighs until his feet touched and forced his body into the shape of penitence. Perhaps now I could give him that side wound into the heart, and he&rsquo;d bleed until he felt like Christ too.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, when I raised my fist to strike the crusader&rsquo;s retribution, I remembered I&rsquo;m a pacifist, and so rolled over as he delivered a few more admirable blows to my face. That was, after all, the Christian thing to do. Turn the other cheek and all that. Seeing as how I acted so morally right, I figured my brother would be compelled to some act of graciousness, if only out of guilt after seeing my illustrious piety. But there was one thing that gave me hope: at the last, my brother had cocked back his foot to give me a one last good punt, and paused. He stood there, poised, for a moment, while I screamed &ldquo;Go on! Do it!&rdquo; He lowered his foot, and strolled off to the hotel. I wasn&rsquo;t certain if he didn&rsquo;t kick because he found me pathetic, or if somewhere in that alcohol flooded brain there was still enough love in him for me as to not deliver that final blow. I wasn&rsquo;t sure which it was, but I was prepared to stay there all night until he came and, for once, acted like a good older brother to me.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was about ten minutes after I decided to lay there all night that I became keenly aware of two facts of life. First, my face was swelling and bleeding something fierce, and could probably use a speedy application of both a cold washcloth and pain killers. The second revelation was that there was no way in hell or any other place in God&rsquo;s creation that my brother was coming for me. I heaved myself up, bits of crusty blood and grass drifted lazily off me and onto the ground. The crickets were chirping. So this, I imagined, is what a circumcised heart feels like. It was, perhaps, time to go to bed.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon entering the hotel room, I was treated to round two. Where fist sufficed for the first bout, our words were used to beat on each other for the next few hours. We&rsquo;d practiced our roles all day with the family, of course. My brother took on the hard bitten cynic, grumbling &ldquo;Fuck your God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kill yourself, if only so that our damn parents will suffer,&rdquo; when the intercourse slowed in awkward places. For my part, I provided simpering pretentious like &ldquo;Mmm, you still love me! You didn&rsquo;t kick me at that last moment!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You can go to hell if you want, but don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t try to help.&rdquo; I believe it was somewhere around my brother admonishing me to suck Jesus Christ&rsquo;s hairy ballsack that I gave up and went to bed. Arguing, I imagine, is a lot like sex.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I woke up the next morning with blood still in my mouth. My tooth had chipped in such a way that every time I talked or snored, its edge would slice against my tongue. I was paraded by the family that day, carrying my thorny crown in big purple blotches and a nice shiner. I went to the Christian folks in my family first, to receive the admonishments against violence. After all, those who live by the sword, die by the sword. I believe I gave them the finger in response, but I regret that now. They are, after all, just pinned down on the weight of their own crosses. I can&rsquo;t knock them too much; at least, they still preach the Gospel through a full set of teeth. Next were the progressives. &ldquo;At least&rdquo;, my Aunt said, &ldquo;you fought over something important. My sister and I used to fight over dresses!&rdquo; I found no answer to this. There is no high-and-mighty nature to a face blotched with blows. That might be why they beat Christ and took his clothes.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no moral to this story. If there was, I would&rsquo;ve learned nothing from what happened. I did keep the chipped tooth though. When I&rsquo;m about to speak judgement on my folks, for any or all of their faults, my tongue always has a nice habit of slipping over that sharp edge. I have to bleed first before I can say anything bad about them. For my part, I&rsquo;ve been to church services of all stripes, attended and led my own summer retreats, and heard some firey words about the nature of grace. But it was on the green grass outside a hotel in Iowa that I got my first taste of the Gospel.&nbsp;</span></span>
