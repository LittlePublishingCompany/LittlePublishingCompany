<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">At that moment as we were all standing there with him, none of us had spoken or even moved. We were staring dumbfounded, in shock.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But he didn&rsquo;t seem fazed by this. Instead, he asked, very casually, &ldquo;So&hellip;do you have anything to eat?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There was something striking about the normality of it, the mundaneness. With those hands, those very solid hands, he took the fish we offered wordlessly to him, and he ate it. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;ve never known of a ghost that could do that.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And then he began to speak, to speak wonderful words, glorious words. He talked about the Scriptures and of a plan. He reminded us of those words he said about how he was going to die&mdash;how he <em>had </em>to suffer and die and how it was ultimately so&hellip;very&hellip;good. How these actions, how his suffering and death, had brought about an utterly new reality. By giving himself in this way, he had broken the power of death. He had crushed the things that ensnare. He had paved the way for renewal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In that moment, everything made sense. And as I looked around at the faces of my companions&mdash;of these ten men whom I knew so well and whom I shared some much with&mdash;I saw their faces transformed. All of the bafflement, terror, and anxiety of the past days fell away, and in its place, there was profound&hellip; relief, and peace and joy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And in that moment I wanted to cry. Not for joy, or for thanksgiving&hellip; No, as I looked at my friends in their rapture at having truly seen him, at having experienced this moment, I was struck with overwhelming sadness.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Because I was thinking of the others, of all who hadn&rsquo;t encountered him, of all who would come after us, I was thinking of all those who would never get to see or touch these hands and feet, who would never receive bread from these hands&mdash;bread that he had broken and blessed, who would never watch these hands reach out to touch, to heal, to cleanse, who would never feel these hands gently wash their own sore, weary feet in heartbreaking servanthood, who would never see these hands stretch out and bring life where there had been death, who would never see and hear and touch.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>How would they know?</em> Is it really something you have to experience to understand, as I fear? Because everything, absolutely everything, hinges on this. In that moment, I was assured of that&mdash;this is the center of reality, this man before me, and all that he had said and done. All he had given and modeled and sacrificed. He changed everything. But I could not see that until I had <em>seen</em> these hands and feet again. Until I had <em>heard</em> his voice bringing the Scripture to life.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>So how will they know? How will you know?</em> There is something different about experiencing, about encountering and being encountered, and here I am trying to <em>explain</em> it, and probably doing a pitiful, substandard job. But I must try.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Because after he said all these wonderful things, while I was still standing there in introspection, he looked me right in the eye and said to us, &ldquo;<em>You</em> are witnesses of these things. <em>You </em>are my witnesses.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We are witnesses. We had seen him, walked with him, encountered him. We had seen his hands and feet, heard his words, witnessed the events of his life and ministry. We had watched them take place.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But now, to be witness did not just mean to stand by and behold the events of his life. Now we had to <em>bear witness to </em>him and the events of his life. We had to share with others, testify to who he was and what he had done.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But I had seen myself, just hearing the words from our friends traveling from Emmaus had not been enough. It would not suffice to merely bear witness by <em>words, </em>as important as words would be. The risen Christ longs encounter us, and to be experienced and encountered by us. The risen Christ, as he had showed us by the mundane act of eating fish, is embodied.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I want others, I want you, to encounter Christ, to experience him as we did. I want this so very badly. But he is not here among us anymore&mdash;not in the same way. He is no longer here for us to physically touch and see.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But I am. And you are.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Just days before his death, Jesus once again did something unexpected and even scandalous&mdash;he knelt before us and washed our feet&mdash;just as the lowliest servant in a household would be called to do. And after he had done this, he said to us, &ldquo;If I, your Lord and Teacher have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hands and feet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
His hands and feet are no longer here, in a literal way, but he has come to us, to each of us, and said &ldquo;peace be upon you.&rdquo; Just as the other disciples and I did when we were out on our missionary journeys together, Jesus has come and asked for hospitality; he has asked to come make his home among us. Within us.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And now I have this great calling&hellip; No, not just calling: an identity. I am a <em>witness</em> of these things. And as a witness, my hands and feet&mdash;all of me, is his. In a mysterious way, it is him encountering the world around me. I must go out now, in the big moments and the miracles as well as the small, seemingly unimportant moments, and be these hands and feet to those who did not get to encounter him face to face in his time on Earth. And those whom I serve, they in turn become witnesses who must go out and do likewise. The risen Christ longs to be encountered, and the world desperately needs to encounter him.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And so I want to leave <em>you</em> with his words: <em>You </em>are witnesses of these things. Amen.</span></span>
