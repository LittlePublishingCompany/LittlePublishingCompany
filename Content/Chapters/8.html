<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; Spinning my ring around and around my finger, her words run through my head on a continuous loop: &ldquo;Forever and always.&rdquo; We were supposed to take on the world together, the ultimate team. Now the glass before me has become the my other half. Maybe Lilly is hiding in the bottom of one of these glasses. I won&rsquo;t know until I drink them all. I feel Jessie&rsquo;s pathetic stare searing me. I throw back the rest of my drink and tap the bar.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last of the Scotch, Jack.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Okay, just give me whatever you&rsquo;ve got; I&rsquo;ll take bourbon, Makers, James&hellip; Just, give me another shot.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tha boss.&rdquo; I can hear the condescension in her tone. Who is she to judge me? She&rsquo;s just some bartending slut. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">***</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The uneasy stiffness in the room is cut only by the murmur from the television. Without the TV on, the dim apartment would be void of sound altogether. Neither of us can bare to look at the other for more than a few moments before leaving the room, and we haven&rsquo;t made eye contact since the hospital. Lilly has scarcely touched her frozen dinner. I look down at my own I realize that I haven&rsquo;t touched mine either. After throwing it away, I take to my place on the couch, which has become my bed. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That godawful rocking chair torments me throughout the night, its monotonous squeaking driving me insane. I&rsquo;ve come to find that excess alcohol is the only way I can achieve any form of comfortable stagnation. Even then, the squeaks jar me awake. She sits there, night after night, hours on end. She just rocks back and forth, back and forth, without end. It&rsquo;s miserable; I have to get out.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grab my coat and slam the door behind me, in search of anywhere that is not there. The dark, cold, bitter night embraces me like a friend.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; I spend several hours at a bar not far down the street, The Angry Catfish. It feels refreshing to actually have a legitimate conversation. &nbsp;The new bartender, I think her name is Jess or something, is friendly. It almost pains me to leave, knowing the despair that inevitably awaits. Why does marriage have to be so damn permanent? I burn through multiple cigarettes on my short walk home, attempting to keep a straight trajectory. As soon as I walk in the apartment, I see her there in that stupid fucking rocking chair. Just rocking back and forth, back and forth. I can&rsquo;t take it anymore. &nbsp;Something inside of me finally snaps.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Stop doing that goddammit!&rdquo; Clearly startled at the surprising sharpness of my voice, she jerks around in the chair to look at me. &ldquo;You think that you&rsquo;re the only one that is hurting right now?! I lost my son too! He wasn&rsquo;t just your&rsquo;s, dammit!&rdquo; I pick up a glass and throttle it against the wall with all of my force, shattering it into a thousands of pieces.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I know,&rdquo; her lips trembling as she struggles to get the words out.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just sit there!&rdquo; The anger building inside of me explodes as I grab her by the arm, tears streaming down her face as I tear her away from that fucking chair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&ldquo;Stop it Jack! You&rsquo;re hurting me!&rdquo; She cries, begging me to let go. I can&rsquo;t--this &nbsp;has gone on long enough. She needs to know how I feel. She needs to feel <em>my</em> pain. She needs to stop being so goddamn selfish. </span></span></p>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Good! Because YOU killed our son! NOT ME! YOU! It&rsquo;s YOUR fault he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; I send her violently into the wall. She slams it hard: her tears begin to merge with blood as shards of glass burrow deep into her scalp. Screaming in agony, she clutches her head and slumps to the floor. Breathing heavily, I turn around and pick up the squeaking travesty. I hurl it at the wall just above where she lays whimpering. Bits of it cascade around her. Her screams drown the sound of my racing heart.</span></span>
