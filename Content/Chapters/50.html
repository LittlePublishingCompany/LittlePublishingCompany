<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">The sun beats down upon the city with its dry, steady pulses. Although the buildings lining the street are tall, they cast no shadows. People huddle in doorways to wait out the summer heat just as they will do tomorrow and the next day and the next day. Rayshawn&rsquo;s sneakers pad the dusty sidewalk. He coughs as he passes a lady beating an old rug outside her window. Turning his head, he sees the flurry of particles fall and bake themselves into the gray pavement. He then turns left down Fitzsimmons Street.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A half dozen blocks further, Rayshawn sees a hotdog stand. A burly Serbian man sits under the flimsy yellow and red umbrella, leaning his head forward to balance a damp washcloth on his hairy neck. Rayshawn approaches timidly. Bottles of water and soda line the top of the stand&rsquo;s glass window. He is thirsty. Rayshawn stands, contemplating his situation, his head floating in the frame of the glass panel separating the hotdogs from the outside. He looks at the hot dogs, which spin on their greasy tracks and let off a smell of stale meat. This makes the drinks on top all the more appealing. No one speaks; the Serbian keeps his head down and his eyes closed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn raises his arm upwards. Why? Is it to steal a water bottle while the man isn&rsquo;t looking? To get his attention? Rayshawn does not have time to decide because at that moment the man behind the stand moves his head and says, &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn remains frozen with his arm in the air. He says nothing. The Serbian drearily inspects the young boy with his one open eye and says in his deep, thick accent.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want? This is not classroom. You put your hand down and say the thing or else you go walking away from this place. I am busy man.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn lowers his hand, wondering whether someone could be charged with a premeditated crime that may or may not have been premeditated and may or may not have been a crime.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to steal that bottle of water!&rdquo; Rayshawn blurts, out pointing to the bottle third from the left. He purses his lips quickly. The hotdog man shifts slightly in his chair. The sweat has stained his white t-shirt underneath his large arms a crusty shade of yellow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is very good,&rdquo; replies the man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another pause. At that moment Leroy walks up to the stand. Rayshawn met Leroy in Mrs. Frank&rsquo;s math class last fall. The two became friends after Leroy sat next to Rayshawn and told him a funny joke about acute angles. They also became friends after Rayshawn let Leroy borrow his basketball after school.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rayshawn!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Leroy.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leroy comes up to shake Rayshawn&rsquo;s hand. They look like businessmen, or at least like how Rayshawn imagines businessmen looking.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you buying a hotdog?&rdquo; Leroy asked.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rayshawn replied.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what are you doing?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. What are you doing?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Just walking.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn had been to Leroy&rsquo;s house before, and although he doesn&rsquo;t know exactly how far away it is, he knows it is pretty far.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ey, if you no going to buy hotdog then you move away for other customers.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no one else near the stand. There is no one else on the block. The big Serbian hotdog man gets out of his chair and leans his elbows on the countertop. Leroy looks at Rayshawn and then at the hotdog man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason Rayshawn can&rsquo;t explain, Leroy&rsquo;s presence gives him courage, or at least enough courage to find words to say to the hotdog man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi, um, can you give me that water for me to drink?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Serbian man looks at Rayshawn expectantly. Rayshawn smiles expectantly. The Serbian man continues to look expectantly. Finally he says, &ldquo;Are you going to pay me money?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn&rsquo;s face falls slightly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; he answers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking. I don&rsquo;t have any money.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either!&rdquo; Leroy chimes in.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hotdog man stares blankly at both of them and snorts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I would <em>like</em> to buy a hotdog. If I had the money, I would pay you,&rdquo; Rayshawn adds.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take this funny money. I accept American dollars, and soon I take Visa when I get to replace this stupid metal cash box,&rdquo; the Serbian man says in his thick accent. He presses a button on the register and the cash drawer spits halfway out. He slams the side and it opens fully.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But if you no have money, then go away from my hotdogs. I am not government with money printing machine. If you want these water then you pay $3.50; that is what sign says. Right here. I work this job to buy my wife stupid shoes and stupid shirt, and I save money so that my son can go to city college and not live in stupid town selling shit hotdogs. You go find $3.50 and then I give you water.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The energy Rayshawn found in the arrival of his friend dissipates. Rayshawn stares through the glass and then down the block, defeated. Leroy amusedly watches a pigeon peck at another pigeon perched on a gutter. Rayshawn mumbles abashed apologies to the Serbian man, Leroy joins in, and they both shuffle off down the sidewalk.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have bought it. I would have bought the water. I wanted to,&rdquo; Rayshawn says to Leroy. Leroy rubs his chin in thought.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leroy replies, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good you didn&rsquo;t steal it tho&rsquo;. That dude would have crushed your head!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just thirsty,&rdquo; Rayshawn states. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thirsty. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to be thirsty.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Leroy says as he bends down to the sidewalk. He picks up a small rock and holds it out to Rayshawn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you put this in your mouth, you won&rsquo;t be thirsty,&rdquo; he says.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn takes the rock tentatively and examines it. He looks at the pavement and lifts an eyebrow in hesitation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Uh&hellip; Maybe later Leroy.&rdquo; Rayshawn puts his hand down, but keeps the rock tucked away in his sweaty fist.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Leroy shrugs. The two continue walking until they reach an intersection. They wait on the corner for the light to change and while Leroy watches the streetlight, Rayshawn raises his hand to his mouth, slipping the rock in between his lips. Leroy looks over. Rayshawn puts his hand down quickly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; Rayshawn asks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; The light turns green and the two boys cross the street.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two walk on in silence until Rayshawn asks, &ldquo;Do you want to play basketball?&rdquo;</span></span>
