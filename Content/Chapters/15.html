<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I honestly don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m here. My hands are too rough for this job.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as I was sitting at my computer daydreaming of literal greener pastures, one of the secretaries who liked me walked by my desk. She seemed excited.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly, I only hear every other word, because my mind is always somewhere else. She had two tickets in her hand and kept pointing at them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We could . . . I mean if you want . . . I know it&rsquo;s not your thing . . . but . . . if you wanted . . . we . . . you . . . then . . . A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream!&rdquo; This is what I heard. I gathered enough to understand. She wanted to go on a date to a Shakespeare play, the one playing at the college nearby.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, she was certainly good looking with her long flowing red hair and a sparkling attitude; but staring at her and half listening, I got the sense I did not want to be around her for any extended amount of time and for no particular reason. I did not dislike her, I just didn&rsquo;t like her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head slightly in a &ldquo;no&rdquo; fashion and her smile reversed to a frown. She stood there for a time in silence then went into begging mode. I just sat and listened without saying anything.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But . . . What about . . . You did say that one time . . . It could be fun.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; was all I said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She left almost crying.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Girls often came by my desk, but not a one of them had that one <em>thing</em>: <em>the spark of life</em>. Wild and untamed as the animals I used to work with on the farm, the spark becomes a flame and the flame becomes a fire and the fire consumes. Like Prometheus, I knew that fire brings light and destruction and rebirth. I take them all, but I have not yet crossed that <em>thing</em>: that <em>spark</em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My desertion into thought ended abruptly with the sound of shuffling entropy. It was quitting time. We, the ants, could march home.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I walked away with my briefcase and matching umbrella, I passed a gathering of office girls. They stared at me, speaking with their eyes, undressing me with them. If they only knew that my true ruggedness, my true beauty, had been dimmed by working on computers.<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I have the time?</em> &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I thought as I looked at my imaginary watch. &ldquo;Not for them.&rdquo; As I walked home, I disappeared yet again into my thoughts: <em>I see the daytripper has such quality time ticking away as if there is no tomorrow, but infinite yesterdays.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I run into something.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook my head and opened my eyes (<em>really opened them</em>) and see I have ran into a ticket booth. The ticket booth is standing outside the theatre of the College. Huge posters are plastered over it advertising the College&rsquo;s production of <em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em>. There, in full Technicolor and shouting, were men with goat&rsquo;s legs and fairies flying over eternal twilight. I gazed a long time at the intricate patterns on the fairies&rsquo; wings until a voice interrupted me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You should go, it&rsquo;s gonna be a great show,&rdquo; the young man in the ticket booth said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I glared at him for a moment but then said, &ldquo;Yeah, I think I will.&rdquo; He smiled as he took my money and handed me the ticket. It was green and glittered in the sunlight. It felt heavy in my hands, but not cumbersome. Something about it fit perfectly in my pocket, but I thought no more of it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night of the play came and I dressed to the nines, which for me meant a nice pair of jeans, dusted boots, and a button up shirt: a country boy&rsquo;s tuxedo.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked from my apartment to the theatre at the College. The night air was cool and somehow reminded me of a bygone age. I heard a loud cry as if someone were being hurt and thought, <em>Such a rough neighborhood so close to the College. </em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got to the theatre there was a long line outside. Eventually, I walked into the dimly lit theatre and found my seat. No one was on my left or on my right, but these were the only two empty seats in the house. This did not matter as the lights suddenly went down and the stage lit up with the actors streaming out onto the stage throwing themselves into a beautiful world.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The play itself entertained, but Titania the Fairy Queen captivated. My eyes focused on her graceful movements. She sparkled and had wings that appeared almost real&mdash;I was half convinced they were. Her black hair flowed to the small of her back, and the makeup on her face was greens and blues and something sparkling.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she entered the stage she ran all the way down to the front, and her blazing blue gaze scanned the audience until it stopped on me. Staring at me she spoke,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>&ldquo;What, jealous Oberon! Fairies skip hence: </strong><br />
<strong>I have forsworn his bed and company.&rdquo;</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant, but she said it to me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she left the stage, I quickly flipped through the program to see the actress&rsquo;s name, and there next to Titania was &ldquo;Dyin Love&rdquo;. The name unsettled me at first, but I was assuaged when she came back onstage and spoke to me again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>&ldquo;Then I must be thy lady: but I know</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;when thou hast stolen away from fairy land&hellip;</strong><strong>&rdquo;&nbsp; </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each word spoken more eloquently than the last, she gazed at me as she performed with every phrase, every speech and every sigh directed to me. I disappeared into her. She was <em>the</em> spark. I smiled at her, feeling her words pass through me and embedding within my soul.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.&rdquo;</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the show, I all but ran to backstage to meet this Dyin. But I was not the only one there. Much of the crowd had found their way backstage, and all were clamoring at this girl who played Titania. She stood away from them still in costume, and guards held the crowds back from her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to the front of the crowd and yelled, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me . . . The one you talked to . . . You know . . . like a conversation . . . I listened&nbsp; . . . I heard . . . I have something to say too.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She did not hear me as she scanned her admirers and sidestepped the roses being thrown at her. The crowd was deafening, but I was determined to garner her attention.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, she suddenly stopped scanning and eyed me intensely. &ldquo;Well hello there,&rdquo; she said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; I said dumbly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Where were you at the end of the show?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am here right now,&rdquo; I said confused.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;At <em>THE</em> end of <em>THE</em> show?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not know what she meant but kept talking to her, but she raised a quick hand said, &ldquo;Goodbye my friend, we&rsquo;ll never be down again.&rdquo; Then the guards pushed the crowd back and my hands reached out to her, but the doors slammed in my face.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood alone outside of the theatre. The wind kicked up, and I felt a shiver as one of the ticket stubs flew into my face. Then I started walking. I never found my way home again.</span></span>
