&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>She</em> said, &ldquo;That is your privilege&rdquo;, as she began to cry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are so lovely when you cry. <em>What nonsense.</em> Two days before she died.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She&lsquo;s the only one that knows I&rsquo;m not crazy, but still she wants to argue it. I don&rsquo;t want to give our bread crust to the kids. It may be the last we ever get.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m still a loner, though the white cat follows me. I never see him come or go. He just is.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a group of fighters on the other side of the city near the graveyards. Adrianna&rsquo;s brother is with them. His name is Christov. He blames me for her death. His hatred makes me want to continue my solitude.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find I still need people for certain things. I ignore Christov&rsquo;s hatred for the moment. I fear he will level me. I guess living is just not hard enough.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the group is a huge shambled building that looks of no importance and that is constantly abandoned. It is anything but. It is Warsaw&rsquo;s secret hospital. Nowhere else is war better understood and nowhere is war more horrible than hospitals. I must go because my cold feels as though it is becoming something worse. I have been coughing up blood lately.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The garden does not want me but I fear it will have me yet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enter into the building from the back. I am emerged into a world of misery.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughters of the garden are crying tonight as their sons bleed onto the tables and die on their beds. The daughters weep so loudly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk past a table where a man lies silently staring at me as he holds his guts from spilling out onto the ground. Blood inches out of his mouth as he stares. I look deep into his eyes as they close and open no more. His hand falls away and so does his viscera, but they do not touch the ground. A nurse runs by and sees him. She turns away, and I see a tear escape her eye.&nbsp; Somewhere someone prays. I do not know to whom.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not want to disturb the nurse further, but as her back is turned I lightly grab her arm and she spins around. She is no longer crying; the faucet turned off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
You will have to go elsewhere if you want a doctor.&nbsp; We are all that is here.&rdquo; She points to the women hustling about taking care of the dying. I don&rsquo;t know what to say, but I see how the daughters of the garden are diligent even in the face of death.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo; She asks earnestly as she can.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very sick&hellip; Coughing up blood. I need medication.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have nothing for you here, but if you&rsquo;re coughing up blood and you stay out in this weather, you will soon die. Even if I had the medications, I do not know if I can help you.&rdquo; She says.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What kind of medicine do I need?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Some sort of antibiotics.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And where can I find those?&rdquo; I ask with some hope.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The hospitals here are destroyed or looted.&rdquo; She stops there as if to think and then says, &ldquo;But there is an asylum in Bydgoszcz. It would have the medicine. I do not know if it has been looted, but the town has been largely untouched by the invasion. You may have luck. I do not know, but it is worth a try.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bydgoszcz is far away, at least on foot.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She nods indicating that our conversation is over. I nod back. The smell of the hospital has now hit me and I feel a lurch in my stomach.&nbsp; It turns violently as if to say you need to leave lest you stay forever. I abide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pass by Christov again, still ignoring him, though I feel his eyes upon me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The miles are lonelier.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I go back I would have happily given away our bread, not to please Adrianna but because it was right. But on this journey there is no more bread. There is only the garden.</span></span>
