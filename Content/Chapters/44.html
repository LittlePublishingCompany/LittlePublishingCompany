&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Phosphorescent jellyfish bloom and bob in the open water. Their calming glows of green and red and blue and purple pulse to a crawling beat, and tentacles hang streamer-like from the thin bodies. Cool sand gives way beneath Rayshawn&rsquo;s feet. His toes curl around it, and slowly lifting his foot, he lets the sand spiral down to the ocean floor. The sensation of the sand runs along his soles. Hairline ripples bend and break across Rayshawn&rsquo;s face as he leans back, eyes closed, craning his neck upwards toward the liquid sun hung just beyond the water&rsquo;s plane. He remains still and submerged within the quiet space, like an astronaut relaxing every muscle as she drifts throughout the blinking cabin of her vessel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the circular windows, stars cycle round in cosmic rotations. A yellow planet rises in the corner, gaseous and gigantic. Rayshawn listens to the whispers of the air vents and watches the scene unfolding before him. A shooting star glitters brightly for a split moment before it fades into the still blackness. Mesmerized, Rayshawn soaks in the silence of the solar system. Inside the spacecraft, cheery lights and buttons blink on and off, indicating that all is well and good. Slowly, Rayshawn swivels his body and pushes off the spacecraft&rsquo;s wall. He glides expertly across the room and a metal door opens revealing a complicated control panel. Screens display place names, numbers, and coordinates. Anyone else would have been dumbfounded by this technological labyrinth, but Rayshawn coolly slides into the captain&rsquo;s chair and begins piloting the ship.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the rotational speed. Maintain velocity. Increase left thruster power. Rayshawn sits back to inspect his handiwork. Suddenly, his face falls. The ship does not respond like he intended. Rayshawn recalculates his commands. He presses on the left thruster again and again but the ship still does not move. Flashing pulses appear on the radar, more than before. Space junk. Rayshawn turns his head calmly towards the forward window. Tiny reflective spots litter the horizon. Rayshawn must fix the left thruster; he must do it now; he must do it perfectly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spacesuit on, he bounds into the airlock; it opens to the dark outside nothing. Air avalanches past him, knocking his head forward. Focus. He swings onto the side of the gleaming ship. The yellow planet that looked so peaceful before now creeps ominously in the distance. Deftly, Rayshawn grabs onto a ledge and launches himself toward the back of the shuttle. Rayshawn looks behind him and wonders whether the safety line is thick enough. He pushes on; time is scarce. He reaches the damaged thruster. He rips off the metal cover and inspects inside. Is it the fuel line? The conductor band? The catalyst? Rayshawn looks up to see the approaching space junk. It is the conductor band. Tools out, Rayshawn begins work. He refashions the slick red cables running to the accelerator base and retightens the couplers. A moment passes. Rayshawn hears only his own breathing amidst the expanse of the universe. The ship jerks, beginning to rotate. Rayshawn releases a relieved and self-satisfied sigh and stares defiantly at the floating space junk; he raises his arms in triumph. At that moment a dark hand descends and grips him by the wrist.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, we got to go Rayshawn!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool water streams off Rayshawn&rsquo;s skin. His sister crouches on the side of the pool, arm outstretched, holding Rayshawn by the wrist. A distinct line shows on her upper arm, dry down to a point and then wet all the way to the tips of her fingers, the arm looks like an alien prosthetic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not time Denise. There&rsquo;s still five minutes,&rdquo; Rayshawn says.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tries to dive back under the water but his sister holds tight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s not. Gloria an&rsquo; me wants to go chill with Rodrick so I gotta take you home. &rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine!&rdquo; Rayshawn protests. He tries to dive a second time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denise yanks hard and says, &ldquo;Mama said I have to watch you, and I want to go, so we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Just leave the bus pass in my shoe, then you can go.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No sir, if you lose that bus pass we&rsquo;re both getting a whoopin&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll just get lost on the bus anyway. You still a kid.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn glares at his sister; he will not get lost. He glares at the alien arm and no longer tries to break free. Sullenly, he looks across the top of the public pool. It is murky, over-chlorinated; children splash and scream; people cannonball into the water washing away their sweat into the pool. A poster for D.J. Dexter Haven floats limply near the filter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ok, ok,&rdquo; Rayshawn says.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denise commands, &ldquo;Go dry off.&rdquo; She throws away Rayshawn&rsquo;s wrist and walks over to join a pretty Hispanic girl, Gloria, leaning against the metal fence.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the bus, Raysahwn bounces up and down on the seat. Denise sits next to him texting intently on her flip phone while Gloria sits one row ahead, gabbing away at Denise&rsquo;s deaf ears. The bus lurches forward. It goes and goes and goes, picks up another person, drops off another person, and goes and goes and goes again. From Rayshawn&rsquo;s position, the overweight bus driver has melted into a large mass of blue fabric and public transportation badges. The bus driver drives the bus and Rayshawn sits back and waits for his stop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out the window, a small woman with a red purse and a small brown dog slips away into the distance. A man wearing a tight shirt and headphones runs along side the bus and for a moment almost keeps up, but he too falls behind. Buildings, trees, people, they are no match for the bus. As Rayshawn watches these things pass by, he notices a few unfamiliar buildings. Has he seen them before? He has ridden this bus route before. Are they new? He cannot remember. Unfamiliar sights continue to stream past. Denise was right, he concedes; he would have been lost. He doesn&rsquo;t know which stop is his. The bus will keep on going and Rayshawn will ride along until he follows his sister out the door.&nbsp;</span></span>
