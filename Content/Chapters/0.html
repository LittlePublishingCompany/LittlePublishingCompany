<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Her name was meant to be Dyane (pronounced &ldquo;Diane&rdquo;), but the birth certificate somehow became muddled and her name came out as Dyin; much like saying &ldquo;Dying&rdquo; with a Southern inflection, where all &ldquo;ing&rdquo; words lose their &ldquo;g&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
They were all in love with her.<br />

<div><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; I can&rsquo;t remember the first time I met Dyin.&nbsp;There were some lockers and some football players. Something about French fries and what we were doing for lunch. I drifted to her and she drifted away from us all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would have grabbed her, but I feel like she would have just floated right through my hands like some ghost or something. She did not have a crowd or even crowds; she was the crowd. She did not go to people, people came to her. This was a fact.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I could smell her scent in the air as she wafted on by, leaving a stream through the currents of air.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No, I do not remember that time at all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Four years later when we were all out of high school and into our sophomore year of college my memories were more vivid, contained; stream of consciousness, fully aware at all times. Maybe too aware.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I was a star on the rugby team. The whole school loved me. But I only wanted her. Dyin would come to me in the night sometimes, carrying dreams like little folded notes and dropping them through the cracks in the window of my dorm. She would be there and then she would not.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When I would question her about it, she would act as if nothing happened and I was crazy, but she was there in the night despite how she acted contrary. Still, our relationship was more than it was in high school because now she actually talked to me.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I would get lost in her words, not actually hearing them. But feeling them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She was eight or nine inches shorter than me, so she must have been 5&rsquo;5 or so. She had the perfect body. Her butt was not too big and not too small as if she worked out often. Her breasts would fit into my hands if given the chance. Her skin was silken in its smoothness and shone in the sun. She had very wavy brown hair that fell to just below her shoulders. It was thick and frenzied my thoughts when I was near it. I could often feel my hands wanting to reach out and touch it, but they didn&rsquo;t. Often she would wear a flower in the midst of her hair. Her face was beautiful beyond compare and her eyes were a sky blue that would lock yours into hers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She consumed me. And if I let her, she would destroy me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Where have you been Brodie? The lights seem dimmer without you,&rdquo; she said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Uh, you know, around,&rdquo; I said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Where will you be when the world ends?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Um, you know, around.&rdquo; I thought she was joking.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;A man of many words,&rdquo; she said laughing as she walked away disappearing somewhere in the haze. Who wants to say more when you have nothing to say.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No. I would not let it end there.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I followed her the best I could while she phased in and out of reality, shifting with the Earth&rsquo;s movements and making gravity as she went.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My feet carried me closer and closer as my hand reached out to her. Her back was so lovely and strong. She did not know I was there.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then my hand felt something solid. I had hold of her wrist. I flung her to me to where she was facing me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She said, &ldquo;So this is where you&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not know what that meant, but I started tearing off her clothes. She was struggling, I think, but I do not remember. Maybe too many blows to the head. I was shaking her violently as I began to unzip my pants and then she just stopped. She stopped moving or struggling. She just lay there looking at me with the sight of the stars in her eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I stopped moving too while both of us were there half naked and bestial staring at one another. I started stepping back and I ran away crying.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have not stopped crying, some forty years later. There in a dank asylum lay an old man crying. I am he.</span></span></div>
