<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">She finds him in the highest turret of the tower, decked in his customary red and black. Through an archer&#39;s window narrower than the span of his shoulders, he gazes pensively over the reflection of the moon, rippling on the waters of the moat. He startles and turns as her shoes scuff the stone. A cold breeze whistles in, ruffling the hem of her virginally white gown, flickering at the torches. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The prince frowns. His pretty, usually vacant face is edged with confusion. &quot;Lady Ava. Did my sister send you?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Against rank, she does not curtsy. &quot;I am surprised to find you here.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He frowns. &quot;I come here often. To think. The air is very clarifying.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is.&quot; She steps closer. &quot;It is a comfort to know our prince is not a fool, or a simpleton.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows of warning rise in his eyes. &quot;You should be cautious with such names, milady. Such words have import that I do not think you want.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Her smile is wolvish, incoherent on such a docile face. &quot;But I do, sweet prince. I do more than most. I know things, too, know that you&#39;re hiding yourself.&quot; She ducks into a curtsey, lips turned up superciliously. &quot;You were so clever. No one would think to look for you as royalty. The Hero, maybe, but never you.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He stills as unto death. &quot;Who are you?&quot; The verb sings with distress, with urgency, the silence of a slaughtered night.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Her shadow billows around her, climbing up the walls over the torches, the planes of her face sharpening as her cheeks wither. She spreads her hands as her fingers lengthen and thin to stabbing points. &quot;I am Hunger,&quot; she says. Her fevered eyes glow hot blue like the heart of a flame. &quot;I am Want. I am Famine. I am Ever Consuming and Never Satisfied.&quot; She leans closer as her shadow floods the room like a cloud, her voice deepening to a violent whisper. &quot;I am <em>Need</em>.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He does not move, save for the rise and fall of his chest, the slow vacancy of color from his face. &quot;Well, very good for you. If you&#39;re done with your theatrics-&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She holds up her right palm to him. &quot;I summon you,&quot; she said. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He cringes, head lowering as if struck. Something writhes under the skin of his face, twisting at his jaw. &quot;Please, stop-&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She throws back her head, tips of her dessicated hair breaking like straw and falling the floor. &quot;I call upon you, and thrice I invoke you.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He doubles over, arms tucked into his chest. &quot;Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t upset the balance. You know the power of a name.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The fire in her eyes brightens. She opens her arms as if to hold the whole world in her bounds. &quot;The Idiot. The Clown. The Teller of Hidden Truths.&quot; He crumples to the ground, chanting in half-caught whispers. Her smile is bright and fulsome as an exploding star. &quot;The Jester, The Joker.&quot; She says the last name with the tenderness of a mother&#39;s kiss, a lover&#39;s caress. &quot;The Fool.&quot; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His body spasms once. The torches flicker in the wind. Her shadow roils on the ceiling. He sighs, his limbs unspooling. In a slow movement, he rises, head listing sinuous like a cobra, eyes closed.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She breathes sharply, touching her spotted fingertips together. Her lips part from yellow teeth. &quot;It is you.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The edges of his mouth rise in something near and far from a smile. His eyes open. They are new and ancient and wide. His voice lilts. &quot;Who woke you, my dear?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She scoffs. &quot;I was charmed asleep and I woke myself with my hunger.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Arm at his waist, he offers a deep bow. &quot;You are a world&#39;s curse and glutton&#39;s delight.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Faint pink brushes the bones jutting over the caverns of her cheeks. She lowers her brittle lashes. &quot;You flatter me, darling.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He laughs, and it drives her shadows scurrying from the lights. &quot;I only ever compliment beautiful women.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She holds out a hand to him, features, for a moment, ripe and winsome. &quot;Let us wake the others and be free.&quot; Her voice breaks. &quot;We have been captive so long.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He catches her wrist and pulls her close, cupping her hunched shoulders with his hands. &quot;Not captive, my love. Asleep. Resting. Was it not peaceful?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She draws back, face withering, fists drawn. &quot;You are a fool. We are imprisoned.&quot; She looks down at her palsied arms, teeth bared, spitting the words. &quot;In these <em>bodies</em>, tricked into thinking we&#39;re human, sad little women in waiting and petty princes in a rotting backwater castle.&quot; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Head canted back, he laughs again, jagged and high. The torches cast half his face in shadow. &quot;I think I make a wonderful prince. I am always fashionable and frivolous, ready with a quip and a laugh.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She stamps a foot, glaring. &quot;I can feel the spells binding me to this body. They chafe. Come.&quot; Her face twists and shimmers, and she is again a rosy-cheeked beauty with simpering brown eyes. &quot;For all your stupidity, you see beyond sometimes, my dear. Let us find the Magician.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He frowns, eyebrows crumpling. &quot;But, my love. The Magician is elusive. Hidden even in his true form. I have not seen him myself in near a dozen centuries. How could we find him now?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She smiles a horrible, hungry smile. &quot;The spells must be his. No one else could weave enchantments so strong. You see and say what others do not. Why do you think I woke you first?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His shoulders slump, and he scuffs a foot on the ground. &quot;Must you be free, my dear? We could stay here. Together. You and I and I and you all safe and hidden. Is it not exhausting to always want?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She draws herself tall and straight, fever brightening her eyes. &quot;I cannot be stayed. I must conquer and devour.&quot; She looks past him, out the arrow-slit window to the night. &quot;I have been bound too long. I can taste the unchecked growth. There are kingdoms and forests and seas to take.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He drops his head like a kicked dog. &quot;Would you not stay for me? I am a fool and a clown and a joke, but was I not once your fool, your clown, your own private and best joke?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Indecision flickers across her face, once, and vanishes. &quot;I cannot deny myself,&quot; she says. Her shadows boil and shift, falling in a tenebrous cape over her shoulders. &quot;If you are too coward to regain yourself, I will find The Magician myself, even if it takes a thousand years.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">The Fool looks up at her, pain spilling from his eyes. He slips one hand behind her neck, closing the space between them, and kisses her gently. His voice is very soft, in the silence. &quot;I am sorry, my love.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She stiffens, whites of her eyes showing. Mania ignites in the edges of his smile and burns into his gaze. She clasps both hands around his right wrist, straining, gasping, unable to budge the glinting tip of the knife from her ribs. Her fingers stiffen as he begins to laugh. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, my dear,&quot; he says. His teeth gleam. &quot;Thrice I asked, and thrice you refused.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice emerges in a scratch as she starts shaking. &quot;You are not my love. Who are you?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am the Joker.&quot; He tightens his grip on the back of her neck, touching his forehead to hers. &quot;I&nbsp;am the Painted Idiot and the Simpleton, and I am Prescience. I am the Scorned Prophet and Mad Wisdom.&quot; He draws back, sweeping his thumb down to the juncture of her neck and shoulder. &quot;You woke me, and you will hear what I say.&quot; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why?&quot; She searches his eyes, bottomless depths of insanity and reason poured in together. &quot;Do you not love me?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to smile, the wide grin of death. &quot;Ah, you speak of love! You of all.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you not wish me free?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is not what I wish. It is that the Magician does not wish so.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And you have joined with him?&quot; She spits at him. &quot;You would listen to such a coward, one who will not even show his face?&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, love,&quot; he says. &quot;The Elusive One, the Masked One. The one everyone sees, but no one sees.&quot; He dips his head once in something like a bow. &quot;The Knave. The Trickster.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Her face petrifies. She shakes her head once, twice. &quot;No. No, you wouldn&#39;t. You wouldn&#39;t do this to me. To any of us.&quot; She tightens her fingers, driving her bones into his wrist. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes her, clacking together her teeth. &quot;This world is too fragile for us, especially for you. We all recognized it, but no one else was willing to make the sacrifice. So I began binding us. It took lifetimes. I&#39;ve had to hunt you around the universe twice, and you nearly destroyed it each time.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Her nails puncture his skin, drawing bright beads of red. &quot;But that is my nature!&quot; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You were not always Want,&quot; he says. &quot;But you do not remember those days, do you? You devoured your own memories when you were hungry and even those did not satisfy you.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The hollows of her face deepen, her skin withering, voice lowering to a rasp. &quot;I consume. I need. You will not condemn me for that.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His smile sharpens. &quot;You woke me after centuries of rest. You invoked me, the Truth-Teller. Don&#39;t blame me if you don&#39;t like what I have to say.&quot; There is a juddering sound. She gasps once, bones sharpening through her flesh. A crimson flower blooms from her side, unfurling its bloody petals through the white weave of her gown.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; she says. Her legs give way, and he lets her fall. Her body crumples to the stone floor. Quavering, her shadow shrinks to its natural shape, crouching beneath her. She look up, face once more round and beautiful, one hand clawing upward. &quot;Please. Forgive me. I promise. I promise I&#39;ll stop.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He gazes down at her, shadow-mask enveloping his face. &quot;Oh, lovely. You say that every time.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Utter confusion blankets her face, and calcifies as the last breath leaves her lungs.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes his head. This enchantment lasted longer than its predecessor, giving him four full centuries of rest. The others rarely stir. They drift for the most part passively from host to host. Some have never woken at all, relieved, he thinks, to surrender the implacable force of their natures. He is the only one whose very nature forbids him to pass away into the darkness of time. The human race never runs a straight path. It needs him, whispering in the right voice, dancing in the best place. Unlike the others, he has no ambition of his own. He does what amuses him, and confounding the rulers of the world entertains like nothing else. </span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hunger&#39;s corpse trembles once and dissolved to a miasma of black vapor. The Tired Magician withdraws a tear-shaped glass jar from his coat and uncorks the stopper. He murmurs three names, unpronounceable by human lips, and the smoke rises lazily, swirling into the jar. He plugs the cork in and speaks the strongest binding spell, watching, a moment, as the essence of his lover billows in the glass. His human hosts usually experience him as a voice of their own subconscious, but sometimes he wonders, in moments of particular awareness, whether he doesn&#39;t let her awaken sometimes. Those savage days of prehistory need never occur again in any existence. He never wants them to. But as his hosts sleep, he turns over in their minds, missing the phantom touch of straw hair and devouring hunger of Love.</span></span>
