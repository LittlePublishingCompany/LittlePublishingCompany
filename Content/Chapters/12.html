<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Bemused by Kurt the Titan&rsquo;s tardiness, I continued back to my apartment. I returned my ear buds to their proper place, and daydreams pulled me from reality. My motor functions were on autopilot, and my mind wandered until the world around was visible yet unseen. That is, until a shrieking clamor dumped a bucket of metaphorical ice water on me. Reality came roaring back just as I was winged by a baby-blue, fixed-gear bicycle with all the bells and whistles. Really, it had bells and whistles on the handlebars. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The bike hit my backpack mostly, but bearing in mind that my backpack weighed a great deal more than a typical one because of its four textbooks (I&rsquo;m a sadist that way, a sadist with lumbar issues), I found myself lying on my back for the second time. Only this time, no one was picking me up. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; My first attempt to roll over failed, because I had forgotten about the equivalent of a fat koala clinging to my back. Just before my second attempt, I heard a voice. It reminded me of a kitten trying to swim in a bathtub in which it could almost not stand. It wasn&rsquo;t in any real danger, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but feel bad for it. I pulled my arms out of my backpack straps and stood up, dusting imaginary dust off my jeans for the second time that day. It&rsquo;s funny how some things, however pointless they are, just seem like the right thing to do. After a brief inspection and satisfactory conclusion that I was in fact unscathed, I looked to the source of the not-drowning kitten voice. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The bicyclist&rsquo;s helmet (thank God for that) had fallen over her face so her identity was still a mystery. Her stylishly ripped jeans and backpack straps were impressively entangled in her bike chain. I rushed over to dislodge her from the bike frame. Since her backpack was caught in the chain, her arms were pinned behind, causing her trouble in removing the helmet. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ummm, can you, like, get this thing off my face?&rdquo; &nbsp;she asked. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">All I could hear were the sounds of a not drowning kitten. &ldquo;Yeah, just give me a sec,&rdquo; I said as I reached to remove her helmet. &ldquo;Are you hurt anywhere?&rdquo; She looked as if I had asked her a confounding riddle. (Personally, I can usually tell if I&rsquo;m hurt due to, well, you know, the massive amounts of pain.) </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&ldquo;Ummmm, I&rsquo;m not sure, I don&rsquo;t thin- LUKE! HI!&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sudden and terrifying reality hit me. I knew who this girl was, and I knew what she looked like naked. Then the real horror dawned; I had forgotten her name. Not in the way you do when you just met someone and they realize a few minutes later you weren&rsquo;t listening&mdash;no, this was the worst possible kind, when you know that you know their name but thanks to the cruelty of the subconscious, you can remember their every meaningless idiosyncrasy (their roommate&rsquo;s name, car, where they live, or&mdash;you know&mdash;what they look like naked on your bed [I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. Stop it. It&rsquo;s not how it sounds. Just wait and see.]) but not their name.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s good to see?&rdquo; Oh crap, I combined <em>What&rsquo;s up</em> and <em>Its good to see you</em> into a sort of Franken-greeting. An image of stitched-together zombie block letters slithered into my mind; for some reason, they were lumbering toward a windmill. Luckily she hadn&rsquo;t noticed what I said, or if she did there was no reaction. I seized the opportunity.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you live pretty far from campus? Why are you riding a bike?&rdquo; I asked, knowing that she lived at least four miles away. I had driven her home before. (Seriously, stop it! It&rsquo;s not what it sounds like, which I know is clich&eacute; but this time it totally isn&rsquo;t. I can feel your judgment and I don&rsquo;t even have a body.) I helped her arms out of the straps and removed her backpack from the bike gears, but the bottoms of her jeans were still wound around the gears. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have a car anymore,&rdquo; she said. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;What happened to it?&rdquo; I asked reflexively, too focused on removing the denim from the gears to act awkward. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I hit a parked car, and Daddy took my keys because he said the insurance was too high.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">My face became marked with contempt (which seems rude, but will make sense soon enough), so frustration spread across hers. &ldquo;What!? It&rsquo;s just&hellip; I mean&hellip; Ugh parking is hard, okay.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; I retracted my scowl and mumbled an appeasement on the difficulty of parking. You know, a blatant lie. &nbsp;But the next question I asked was too important to avoid. It burned in my chest with all the intensity of a jungle cat&hellip;. on fire. &ldquo;So wait, what happened to the Porsche?&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; She looked down and pulled her bike helmet defensively to her chest revealing the inside, which contained five letters. Five beautiful letters. S-A-L-L-Y. They were the best five letters I had read all day. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I kind of wrecked it a couple of weeks before I hit the parked car and it died&hellip; so did the tree that I hit with it. I had problem&rsquo;s parking my Mom&rsquo;s Escalade, and now it&rsquo;s in the shop, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m riding my bike to class.&rdquo; There was a pause. &ldquo;But at least I&rsquo;m helping the environment!&rdquo; She smiled genuinely from ear to ear.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My soul began to weep, which I suppose is like regular weeping now&hellip;weird. This is probably a good time to explain to you how Sally and I met.</span></span>
