<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">Denise pulls open the door of the apartment building, and Rayshawn slips in behind her, pushing his shoulder into the closing door. He takes a moment as his eyes adjust to the streaky blues and grays of the dim hallway. Up a few flights of stairs, the two turn into their suite. Denise heads directly to her bedroom, leaving Rayshawn standing in the soothing entryway. Windows have been thrown half-open all around the house and the warm breezes that slide across his arms and neck are a welcome change to the stale afternoon heat outside. A fan drones on with a &ldquo;buzz buzz&rdquo; in another room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the kitchen, Rayshawn throws his towel over the back of a wooden chair. He then stretches high to reach a cup from the cabinet. He goes over to the kitchen sink and turns on the faucet. Barely a trickle runs out of the tap, and it soon slows to intermittent drips and drops. He tries the other handle only to discover the same thing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no water! They gone turned it off.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn peers around the kitchen corner into the cramped living room. His mother sits in an orange armchair facing the window; she sweats in front of a rotating fan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! All I know is that the water&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cell phone sits wedged within the dirty, wet space between her jaw and shoulder. Her hands cut out coupons from a newspaper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I han&rsquo;t even called them yet, honey. I just called right now to tell you what I know.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment&rsquo;s silence. The initial coolness of the apartment has worn off; the air feels heavy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rdquo;No! I ain&rsquo;t got money for that! It&rsquo;s too hot to do anything anyhow, I just haveta sit here till someone comes n&rsquo; turn it back on,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rayshawn returns silently to the kitchen. He tries the sink again. Nothing. &ldquo;They&rdquo; turned the water off, and hopefully &ldquo;they&rdquo; will turn it back on. He presses the cup up against the refrigerator hoping to find refreshment there. Truthfully, the refrigerator water has been broken since the day Rayshawn&rsquo;s uncle dropped off the appliance five years ago. He came with his big friends who laughed a lot and stepped heavy-like on the floor. They chatted a bit with Rayshawn&rsquo;s mother and watched some of the football game on the big, boxy TV. Rayshawn&rsquo;s uncle sat in the old, beige armchair that used to belong to Rayshawn&rsquo;s dad. His uncle turned it just right so that he could talk and watch the game at the same time.&nbsp; Then the men carried out the old refrigerator that made the funny boat noises and replaced it with this one. So far there have been fewer boat noises but still no water. Rayshawn knows there isn&rsquo;t any water, but that does not keep him from pressing the cup to the lever.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opens the refrigerator door. He feels a cool shiver scurry down his spine.&nbsp; Mixing with the summer heat, the cold makes him feel sick. His eyes scan the refrigerator&rsquo;s insides. There&rsquo;s just a bit of cold milk left in the gallon jug with the cow printed on the label. He&rsquo;s tempted to drink it, but Rayshawn pushes the thought out of mind as best he can. His mama will know if he drinks the rest, and if his mama knows, then he will most definitely know that she knows. A few cans of beer line the inside door. Rayshawn also knows that boys are not allowed to drink beer. It makes people loud. Sometimes it makes them angry. Phrases like &ldquo;make loud&rdquo; or &ldquo;make sad&rdquo; sound better than &ldquo;drunk&rdquo;. The refrigerator door has been open for too long; Rayshawn closes it before his mother yells at him from the other room.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sits down on the floor and flicks his tongue against his top row of teeth. By now his mother&rsquo;s conversation has mingled into the samewise drone of the fan and the city traffic three stories below. His left hand still holds the empty cup. The cup is a cup. The chair with the towel is a chair with a towel. The faucet with no water is a faucet with no water. There is nothing to do at home, he is still a little thirsty, and so Rayshawn grabs his basketball and heads back out onto the street.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he closes the door, Rayshawn calls out, &ldquo;Ma! I&rsquo;m going to play basketball!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A voice ricochets from the living room, &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></span>
