<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;My name is Luke Deckard, and I have a story to tell you. It&rsquo;s a story about interesting people, odd events, and the beautiful nature of life. A little background about myself &ndash; I&rsquo;m a sophomore and Lit major at the University of&hellip; erm.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It just occurred to me I used to be all of those things. It&rsquo;s a bit complicated, now that I put more thought into it. Sorry. I&rsquo;m a little disoriented right now; see, I&rsquo;ve had a very busy day. I don&rsquo;t mean busy in the usual way. A busy day usually meant having a six-page paper and a test coupled with a club meeting or something like it. Today was the kind of day I didn&rsquo;t expect to be busy, and it really wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be, but without warning a rogue wave of people, problems, and mishaps capsized it. Sorry about the elaborate metaphor. I do that&hellip; a lot. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s the kind of day you feel dead at the end. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Also as a side note, that unfortunately is not metaphor or hyperbole. I am dead, dead-dead. (Killed dead by death with death. That&rsquo;s hyperbole, but still quite literal.) Now that I think about it, being dead is more or less the reason that I&rsquo;m feeling so scatterbrained. Not having a body will do that, apparently, just take my word for it. &nbsp;Now I should make this very clear - my death is nowhere near the most important part of this story. In fact, as weird as it is to say, it might be the least important. What comes out of it, well that&rsquo;s something else altogether. I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself, but for the interest of saving you time (I don&rsquo;t really have to worry about the whole &ldquo;time&rdquo; thing anymore), I&rsquo;ll start this story in the same way dreams do. Right in the middle with no idea how you got there. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually, the class was not bad, but for some reason I was unfocused. Okay, that&rsquo;s a lie. I knew exactly why. &nbsp;I spent all night on the Internet researching gun restriction laws in Russia. There wasn&rsquo;t any real reason for it, and at 2:00 AM it seemed like the best thing to do. Hindsight is a vile mistress, and for that matter, so are 8:00 AM modern literature classes. I appreciated the class, I did, but 30 minutes in and all I could hear was the garbled, static voice from Charlie Brown&rsquo;s teacher, until my face slipped hand and, in a very sudden fashion, collided with my desk. This of course comes along with all the sounds and twitchy motions a person makes when their face hits a desk at Mach 3. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My professor rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Well on that note, I have a conference to prepare for, so just a few last announcements and I&rsquo;ll let you out early.&rdquo; She kept speaking, but it just drifted back into Charlie Brown noise. The next coherent things I heard were &ldquo;Class canceled next time&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;You&rsquo;re free to go.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Without warning, I was awake as I had ever been, like I had an IV drip of RedBull. I packed by bags with the lighting speed but then realized I had to wait on everyone else to pack up and shuffle out the door. As I stood there rubbing my face, the guy in front of me made a beeline for the professor before she could leave. I wondered at the time what he was talking to her about &ndash;I found out later, but I&rsquo;ll talk about that when we get there. As soon as I made it out the door, I was home free, or at least that what I thought. See, that&rsquo;s when my day becomes interesting. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was walking down the University&rsquo;s Main Street on the sidewalk, admiring the red brick buildings and wondering how old a specific building was in relation to the age of the university. I had my ear buds firmly in place, blasting some obscure song, suffocating my awareness of the surrounding world. As I was scrutinizing the color and texture of the bricks, trying to estimate its age, as if I could ascertain this information by simply staring at them, another person bumped into me. Now, when I say bumped, I mean that I bounced off a massive specimen of the collegiate male variety. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You okay down there, little brah?&rdquo; asked this looming colossus of a person. He was wearing a backwards trucker cap, peach colored pocket-less shorts, and a green t-shirt with white block lettering that read &ldquo;Jesus is my homeboy.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled out my ear buds, so as not to offend the behemoth before me, and we exchanged apologies. &ldquo;Yea, I&rsquo;m fine. Its all good,&rdquo; I responded as he ripped me off the ground with a tug. &ldquo;I should have been paying more attention to where I was going.&rdquo; He called me little; I&rsquo;m near 6 foot and 170 pounds, Once I had stood and dusted the imaginary dust from my jeans, I intended to return to my apartment, but the titan stuck out his hand in a very robotic manner and introduced himself as Kurt. Caught off guard, I grabbed his hand and blurted out, &ldquo;Luke!&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have a minute to talk, brah?&rdquo; Kurt asked me. And in an attempt to not offend my new titanic friend, I obliged him with a simple &ldquo;sure.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His next question struck me in an odd way, not because of the content of the question, but because the context: we, on the sidewalk, suffering the Tuesday morning sun; it just seemed a little out of place. It was like when a friend covers a popular song and changes a part of it. It never sounds right. (It&rsquo;s also hard to take a man seriously when he keeps calling you an article of Womens underwear) </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Kurt looked me in the eyes and asked me point-blank, &ldquo;Do you know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord as Savior?&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, I was taken aback by the question. I stuttered, &ldquo;Well yeah&hellip;. I&rsquo;m a Christian and I was baptized when I was like 12&hellip; I think.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Right on, brah, right on.&rdquo; His response was mechanic, like a voicemail rehearsed with a counterfeit west coast accent. It was clearly practiced. &ldquo;But do you really know Jesus, like know him, man?&rdquo; asked Kurt the Titan (which was now his name in my head). &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now this version of his question puzzled me. I mean, I was in fact a Christian, so I felt like I had the right to say yes, but it felt strange too. But in order to maneuver around Kurt the Titan I gave what I thought a very passable answer and a quick way out. I cleared my throat and spoke, &ldquo;I know Jesus is Lord and my savior, but it&rsquo;s not like we hang out and have a beer or anything.&rdquo; I should have ended with the word savior, but no, I had to try to be funny. Dumbass.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well man, I don&rsquo;t think he would drink alcohol, but I know for sure he wants to hang out with you, man. He&rsquo;s told me so. We chill out together on the reg.&rdquo; Kurt said this without so much as flinching. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to choke back my cynicism as best I could, lest this bro-hemoth (patent pending) stamp out my unrighteous light. I should make it clear there was no point when Kurt was aggressive, but I tend to become nervous around muscle-bound individuals. I also had to fight the impulse to make a &ldquo;water to wine&rdquo; comment, but that would have been unnecessarily flippant. (Moreover, that argument has always bothered me, because no one actually argues it correctly. They just pull it out of their ass whenever it suits them then act smugly like no one has ever thought of it before. But I digress.) I momentarily stared at Kurt the Titan and then blurted the only word that I could muster, praying it would not offend Kurt the Titan&rsquo;s delicate sensibilities. &ldquo;Neat!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As luck would have it, the clock tower bells signaled the passing of the hour (just in case you didn&rsquo;t know what those bells have meant all your life, you do now), and Kurt the Titan eyed the clock hands with frustration. &ldquo;Sorry Luke, I wish we could talk more and I totally think we should, but I have a Social Wellness class I&rsquo;m gonna be late for. So I gotta jet.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Before he did, he thrusted a flyer at me, which appeared in his hand literally out of nowhere. (When I say &ldquo;literally&rdquo;, I mean it. He apparated a flyer. [Harry Potter-style] His hand was empty and then it was suddenly holding a flyer.) It was for his church. He told me that he hoped to see me there on Sunday.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-family:georgia,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I simply stood there, holding the flyer, and gave him a very non-committal nod, coupled with the most benign of smiles as he power-lumbered away. I then wondered to myself if the university considered evangelism an excuse for tardiness.</span></span>
