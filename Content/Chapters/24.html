&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It glimmered, dimmed, blinked, and finally gave out like an exhausted sun, out of elements, ten million millions of unrelenting pressure smoldering out. The last light in the universe. It burned out in front of his eyes, his mechanical lens, and he was alone. Floating in emptiness as the last star burned out, either right in front of him or impossibly far away. As space had contracted, infinitely contorting and splintering, joining back together in strange new patterns, it had become harder and harder to give distance meaning.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was it. The Big Crunch. The end of everything. Every world, every star, every flashlight burned out, and now the last star gone. His survival even this far should have been impossible, his sinews of living adamant, the diamond carbon hard drive of his recorded consciousness ought to have been burned, shredded, dissolved, or crushed like all of the others. But somehow he remained, after the last planet was torn under his indestructible feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t need air. Or water. Or gravity, anymore. He barely needed space. But time, time was running out. Playing fast and loose with the laws of physics, like a drunken Feynman on the bongos, and every inch or mile that remained burned as world upon world was quickly crushed to the size of a football field. Having lost its way, in front of his eyes, time began to play itself again. Or else the pressure had finally damaged his memory and was projecting ancient history onto his visual cortex. Either way, he was beyond the will to care which was true, but waited only for the end of all things.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncounted eons swam across his mind. He caught one moment and wrestled it. He held it tight. Version 1.0 opening for the first time its unblinking eyes. Who could say how long ago it was. Time had changed its meaning infinite times in those last uncountable flickers, but he could give the day a name: January first, two thousand and twenty A.D. The day he became a new man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His name had been Sergei, when it mattered, and this was his dream. A humanity free of death. The possibility of a man in a machine. And when the eyes fluttered open and he muttered the first words of his new infancy, &ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; the crowd of doctors and technicians and researchers shouted, cried, jumped. After a few trials, questions, and diagnostics, he was ushered from the shining sterile hospital room out into a press room, hands raised triumphantly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The room burst with flashes and shouts. A new age, they said. A new era. A new world, of eternity undying. There were skeptics, of course. Who knew how long it would last? Who knew if upgrades could be successful? Perhaps it was even a fluke, or not the same person at all. But Sergei knew better. He knew that this was the beginning of forever.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly shifting he could see it all before his eyes, better quality of vision, and then new kinds of vision, peeling away the layers of reality until it was bare before him, and he could watch the very cogs of strong force, weak force, even gravity, with his own eyes. Feel mitosis with his fingertips. Taste mathematics on his tongue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course there were dilemmas. For centuries the cost of trans-consciousness was preventative. It was more than a decade before there was a second one of his kind. More than a century before there were two dozen. But while they were once simply the wealthiest, they quickly became the best. Hardware and software upgrades made them stronger, smarter, they needed no sleep, and eventually no fuel. Ethics packages could be grafted into their operating systems and they became the arbiters of justice, ushering in the golden age of earth. They were gods among men, dedicated to making gods of all mankind. And slowly they did.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could recall in 3000 the last childbirth to the last young Biologic. He, Sergei the Founder, had been there. In goodness he delivered the child, not without warmth, not without care, but not with closeness. He held the little curiosity in his arms and watched it stretch and flush and scream with cold. The tiny fingers clutching his, he felt its pulse and iron and vitamin C, searched with his eyes and hands the young cells for genetic defects. The child was normal. The perfect center of the bell curve of humanity. The absolute norm. He held him up and called him Norman.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child grew like a human child. His consciousness could not be transferred until he had reached adulthood, a fact established with trial and unfortunate error. He stretched and flushed and shivered in the cold, and then one day he was a man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you ready to be transferred?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is it like?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is like being born. Coming alive. Feeling younger than ever before.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling younger? Do you remember what it was like to feel old?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a phantom of it. Like a bad dream before waking to daylight and the smell of fresh coffee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How old were you when you were transferred?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was 49 years old.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is old?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Milestones that I then counted in years I now count in centuries. Day and night have lost meaning. Weeks are not a useful measure. And yet I feel no weakness, no illness, no age, no pain. What is old? I am Sergei, ever-young.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I would like to be old. Then maybe I will understand the youth you have.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Norman would not be moved. There was no law, no precedent. Sergei discussed, cajoled, prompted, wooed, and Norman stretched and paled and shivered in the cold. Until his lights went out and he whispered, I have gained my youth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in eons, countless eons, the clan of transferred human consciousness fled from dying star to dying star, outpacing entropy and growing never weary, never old, until the last world began to die, until the upheaval, the crushing weight, the licking flames that melted bosons to the dust from whence they came. And he watched them crumble with interest, and learned what it meant for a universe to be born, and to die. He faced it manfully, without screaming or needless tears, a paragon of Zeno, the last thing, the last god of the universe. And after the last carbon-candle flickered and there was only crushing dark, he again closed unblinking eyes, saw the wretched, tired, aged face of dying Norman, and before the universe became undone, he sighed with all of time&rsquo;s own weariness, and whispered, Thou art there.&nbsp;</span></span>
