<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand; why do people waste so much money on these tacky colored lights and then spend hours &lsquo;decorating&rsquo; their houses and buildings. What is the appeal; is there like a contest or something at the end of the year? Why put so much effort into something that they&rsquo;ll just have to take down in a few weeks anyways? Most of all, why put so much effort into such an ugly hobby?&rdquo; Every year the glow seems exponentially brighter, it looks as though Hallmark vomited their excess holiday spirit all over the downtown area.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well I think it looks charming, it&rsquo;s the fresh layer of snow that really gives it that extra&hellip;&rdquo; Her hands move gracefully through the air imitating a shining star as she runs forward, breaking through a barrier that only she can see. Stopping a few yards in front of me in order to make a swift twirl, &ldquo;come on Jacky, can&rsquo;t you just give it a chance? What, are you afraid that you might actually have a little fun?&rdquo; She plays with her lower lip, biting it softly as she strides back towards me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just go somewhere this year? Maybe take a break from the city for a while; Montreal, Paris, Italy, or if you&rsquo;re feeling a bit more&hellip; adventurous: we could even hit Michigan.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my,&rdquo; the outlandish accent of an 1800s southern belle practically second nature, &ldquo;one state over? You lead a dangerous life Jackson Bennett; if you&rsquo;re not careful, people may start to talk.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, in that case, we might as well give them something to talk about.&rdquo; I reach for her hand and pull her in close to me. Her right hand rests softly on my chest and her forehead pressed gently on mine; she closes her eyes and slowly slides her hands up toward my neck, resting them around me. As I lean in closer the corner of her mouth twitches upward in anticipation; I linger just out of reach for a moment before I deliberately graze her lips ever so slightly before pulling away.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Quit teasin&rsquo; me Jacky,&rdquo; biting her lower lip softly she guides my head into the placement of her choice. I close my eyes and embrace her soft gentle lips; everything else seems to just&hellip; fade into the abyss. </span></span>

<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; The scream of the feral cat outside seems to become progressively louder as I lie awake in my bed. That damn cat haunts me every night, crying loudly outside my apartment; I can&rsquo;t decide whether he&rsquo;s in pain or not. Maybe he&rsquo;s just lonely and just wants the world to know that he&rsquo;s there, and so he screams his insignificant existence to whoever is around to hear it. Either way, he&rsquo;s fucking annoying.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The alarm clock reads two-o&rsquo;-seven. I reach over and feel the once occupied space next to me, caressing the pillow that had once rested long, golden locks. On rare nights when I do find the solace of dreams, I often roll over in anticipation that someone is waiting for me on the other side, waiting to laugh at whatever random thought running through my mind; yet I only find an overwhelming sense of abandonment in the emptiness of this oversized bed. Gently, I stroke the place where she used to lay; I trick myself into thinking that I can still smell her coco-butter shampoo. I always hated that shampoo, yet now I find myself pining after it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As I get up and walk to the bathroom, I pause to look out at the early morning sky; the stars just visible over the dim city lights. </span></span>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">***</span></span></div>
<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;So what is that one?&rdquo; Circling my finger around an ambiguous cluster of stars that rests amongst the endless sky. I don&rsquo;t even know if she can tell where I&rsquo;m pointing (hell, I&rsquo;m not even sure if I can tell where I&rsquo;m pointing). But, she still scoots in closer beside me, leaning her head next to mine as she closes one eye in order to follow my finger all of the way up it&rsquo;s invisible trajectory. Pausing for a moment in order to &ldquo;accurately trace the constellation&rdquo;.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Eros. God of loooove,&rdquo; making kissing sounds as she extended the word.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making that up.&rdquo; Her grin gives her away as she starts laughing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;How about you ask me about,&rdquo; she takes my hand and guides it closer to where the moon lies dormant and draws a pattern as she connects the shimmering dots in her mind, &ldquo;that one.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; smiling as I eagerly await a sarcastic remark, &ldquo;tell me about&hellip;&rdquo; pausing as if to be thinking about where to look next, &ldquo;that one.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Well, that would be Kuekuatsu.&rdquo; A slight smile appears as she says his name.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Kiwikijatsu&hellip; Let&rsquo;s see, wasn&rsquo;t he the God of&hellip; bullshit?&rdquo; as I gently squeeze her side causing her to squeal with laughter. Smiling, I slip my arm under her as she nestles her head on my chest, her hand resting softly over my heart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;No, that would be Bullshiticus,&rdquo; as if I should obviously know that already. &ldquo;Kuekuatsu, It means &lsquo;lonely wolf&rsquo;. He was the fire-bearer of the spirit world and his lover, Tengoku, was the protector of the heavens. The two would wander the endless skies together, creating beautiful masterpieces for each other along their way. But, Kuekuatsu had a twin brother, Nogitsune, who was the trickster. Nogitsune also loved Tengoku and he became jealous of the two. So, one day the trickster told Kuekuatsu that Tengoku longed for a magnificent orb of light that could only be found on the realm outside of the spirit world. But what Kuekuatsu didn&rsquo;t know, was that once you leave the spirit world, you can never go back.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;So, the lonely wolf howls to the sky, desperate to return to Tengoku. Tengoku, knowing that they will never be together, took the most radiant orb from the spirit world and placed it in the center of the night sky that separated them, symbolizing her eternal love for him.&rdquo; Her face is partially hidden from my view, but I can still hear the sadness in her voice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Deciding not to disrupt the lingering somber tone with a burst of humor, I allow the stillness of the brisk winter night to wash over us as we lay on the barren ground, the glimmering stars dancing above us.</span></span>
