<strong>The Ghetto<br />
January 25, 1943</strong><br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last thing <em>she</em> said to me was, &ldquo;How do I know I see the same blue as you?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no answer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still don&rsquo;t.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The snow hasn&rsquo;t let up. I&rsquo;m forced underground to find some relief from the bitter cold.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m disappointed I have to share it with the school.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Przyszlasz is happy to see me, but I&rsquo;m not happy to be here.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come sit with us Feliks, we&rsquo;re learning about the alphabet. Where is Adrianna? The children have been asking for her.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look up at her and I sigh heavily. &ldquo;She is gone.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Przyszlasz shakes her head and speaks no further on the matter. She begins reciting the polish alphabet to the youngest children.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit in the corner of the open space, trying my best to find sleep. I feel like I have finally drifted when I feel a light tapping on my shoulder. I open my eyes to see little Izolda standing in front of me with her hands behind her back. She is swaying back and forth playfully. Her golden air shines in the dim light of the sewer anteroom.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; She asks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I sigh heavily. &ldquo;Trying to sleep Izolda, you should do the same.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But Mrs. Przyszlasz says it&rsquo;s twelve o&rsquo;clock, it&rsquo;s time to eat lunch, not sleep.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another sigh.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she is right. I have not eaten in days and if they have food, who am I to turn it down?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must have slept longer than I thought for the classroom has disbanded, all except for Izolda, little six-year-old, Izolda.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw Adrianna&rsquo;s body, Feliks.&rdquo; She says flatly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good for you&mdash;what were you doing above ground?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Everyone knows the good rats live near the Germans. Where do you think lunch came from?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fine let&rsquo;s go, they won&rsquo;t stay warm for long.&rdquo;&nbsp; I say to her and partly myself. What can I say? You never get used to eating rats, but it&rsquo;s better than starving. Hopefully, there&rsquo;s some salt. I slowly stand, and my eyes adjust to the darkness of the sewers. There are only a few candles. The old librarian Piotr is always sitting around one, reading stolen books. I&lsquo;ve only seen him above ground few times, and that was at night when he was sneaking into what was left of the library. It&rsquo;s sad, but I envy him for his dedication. It&rsquo;s his way of escaping the garden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Izolda leads us into another chamber, larger than the previous, there&rsquo;s a huge table there.&nbsp; Several of the fighters are here and all the kids and Mrs. Przyszlasz too. Mr. Przyszlasz is also there. He leads this group of resistance. I sit next to him, and Izolda next to me; she dangles her short legs underneath the chair restlessly. The whole table is agitated, ready to eat, even if it is just rats. Mr. Przyszlasz quiets us down and says a Christian grace. Then his wife brings out a pot filled with rat soup and gives us all ladelfuls.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I listen to the men talk about our plight, the plight of the garden.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dreaming Bolek, if you think the Americans or anyone else are going to help us. We&rsquo;ve been here four years and not a soul past the Germans have stepped into our city. The Russian bastards claim our country as their own, yet they stand outside the city laughing at us.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You wait and see Gabrys, the Americans will come.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, but by the time they get here there&rsquo;ll be nothing left.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Przyszlasz, better known as Motti, breaks in (his voice bellowing), &ldquo;Close your mouths at this table. These are not suitable subjects for eating.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more was said on the matter, and we all continued eating in silence for a while, until Bolek started in again. This time on me. &ldquo;Little Lone Wolf, why do you not come with us on our next run into the city? We could use your eye in the field.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I only have eight bullets left.&rdquo; I say as if that&rsquo;s an actual answer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He laughs. &ldquo;You always did have the smartest answers.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groups get killed. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m alone. That&rsquo;s why I stay alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the kids near the corner of the room lifts a box and opens it, &ldquo;Look Mrs. Przyszlasz, chocolates, and there&rsquo;s enough for all of us!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look to Mrs. Przyszlasz and I see her give an ominous look to Motti.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, Lew, those are not for now, we must save them for later.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the children groan and begin whining.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But we want them now.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, can&rsquo;t we just have one?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motti throws his fists down on the table heavily, quieting the room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough! They will not be eaten now, only when I say!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the table, the soft meowing of a puny, white cat defies Motti.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decide I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable anymore, so I quickly finish eating and leave my plate and fifteen kids, Mrs. Przyszlasz, Motti, and the squad of eight fighters. Izolda watches me as I cross the room quietly, the white cat following me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Przyszlasz won&rsquo;t let it go though. &ldquo;Feliks, where are you going, dinner is not over yet.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn to her, contemplating what I can say in that moment, but nothing is good enough. I keep it simple. &ldquo;Out.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t look, but I can feel the sad look on Izolda&rsquo;s face as she watches me leave, the cat still following me at a slight distance. I grab my rifle from the corner of the sewer school and make my way up the ladder going to the manhole. I put my ear up to the sewer cover. It&rsquo;s quiet, so I slowly push it up, making sure to make no sound.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily, the manhole is in a secluded alleyway, so it is not common for Nazis to be present. Though if I&rsquo;m honest, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll find this place soon enough.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m above now, looking around to make sure I am alone. I then move back to cover the sewer. As I do, I see at the bottom of the ladder that the cat was following me. It is sits at the bottom looking up at me. Something about the animal makes me uneasy, so I quickly close the sewer and try to shake it from my mind.
