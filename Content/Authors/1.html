	Lately, when people ask what I do, I list off four jobs and sarcastically include how valuable my Master’s of Divinity is on the job market. Then I may mention I am starting a publishing company. Most people reply, “Cool!” or “You sound busy,” and our small talk concludes. 

	I’m not much for small talk. 

	I’ll tell you who I am:

	I have stayed a dirt road of sin. I have held courage and tasted cowardice’s sweat. I have endured enough to know somethings are worth fighting for—somethings matter, and I will fight for the things that matter. I will fight for fiction, even if it comes to blows.

	I am Murphy McLeod Little. I am an American gathering ‘round the campfire.
