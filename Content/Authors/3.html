“Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts.” 
― Patrick Rothfuss, The Name of the Wind

I am a lover of simple things, coffee, conversation, good humor, paradoxes, and Truth.  Oh, and Words. Words are important too. I love a well worded joke especially when it’s all wrapped around a Truth. The best, you ask? That’s when you take that joke-wrapped Truth and place it snugly in a box made of lies. There, fiction is born. Don’t worry friend. We’re all mad here.
