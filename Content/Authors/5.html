	If I had my preferences, I would say that I am some colorful, horribly named, and weirdly powered Flash villain – that I am just misunderstood, that I was mistreated as a child, that I simply robbed banks to get by in life, and that I needed a crew of likeminded individuals in my life. Flash would just try to get in our way and stop our good time. Yeah, that’s it.  
	What would my power be? Well, writing of course. It’s not a good power, nor do I use it well. No one can make much sense of it, but it does make a good paperweight. Flash would wonder why he even bothered with me in the first place. But that’s the thing about Flash villains isn’t it? They are horribly and dangerously underrated. Writing is a nice power. It is life – read, write, edit, publish – rinse and repeat.
