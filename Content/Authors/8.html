“The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.” – Albert Camus

	Some people call me the space cowboy, some call me the gangster of love, and some people call me Maurice (which is weird because that’s not even a little bit close to my name). Once they finally get my name straight, they come to find my happiness comes from movies, motorcycles, and performing impromptu puppet shows. My true passion is unearthing the impossible, so someday I will find Bigfoot.
	Death is inevitable, but life is optional. If we conform to the ideas of others, we limit our individuality so severely that we may as well consider ourselves dead already. I live to find happiness in life regardless of wherever it may be hiding; because the world is beautiful, even in its darkest places. So we should live for brighter days and never give up on a life less frightening. Also, eat lots of sno-cones and pizza.

Stay weird,
me
