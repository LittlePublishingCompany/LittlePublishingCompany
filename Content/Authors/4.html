Madeline is a perpetual student with one degree in book-reading and most of a second in theology, while trying to figure out where to apply for the third. She spends a lot of time studying. When she isn’t, she’s running, reading fantasy, grading Greek quizzes, puzzling out others’ Meyers-Briggs personality types, writing (don’t look all surprised, this is an author’s biography, after all) dying her hair unpredictable colors, investigating various words’ etymologies, or cooing over puppies. She fuels the aforementioned activities with copious amounts of coffee and the occasional cupcake.
