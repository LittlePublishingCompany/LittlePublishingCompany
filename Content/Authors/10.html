	Lp Co. is a digital campfire for storytellers and readers to share and discuss stories. This generation is replete with information and inter-connectedness but we are remiss of community and story. We have lost our center. Lp Co.â€™s purpose is to help America rediscover its center by sharing stories worth talking about and creating a vibrant community that examines those stories and, ultimately, life.
