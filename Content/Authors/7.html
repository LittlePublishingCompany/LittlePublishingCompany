Being born the child of Mexican immigrants lets me see things differently.

For 10-year-old me, life wasn’t black and white. It was black, white and brown. The Rio Grande Valley (the southernmost tip of Texas), was neither here nor there. It was neither America, nor was it Mexico. It simply was. My language was neither English nor Spanish, and my family was neither American nor Mexican. We just were. 

This context allowed me to be raised between two worlds. 

On the soccer field, we called the ESL kids, “Mexicans” while we were the “Americans.” While we watched the silver screen, we marveled at the White, Black and Asian characters with the same curiosity a preschooler feels when he discovers that his parents are his parents. 

You could look up DSM IV-V and find a disorder for this. Someone could find a label. 

I would rather save you some time and tell you a story.
