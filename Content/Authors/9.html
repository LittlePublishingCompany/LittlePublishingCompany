	I am the last born of two parents who raised me in the Southern Baptist Church. I am not a southern girl, however, but have dreamed a new life for myself. I am enraptured with Animal Ethics and Modern Christian Theology, and in my love for animals and theology I have found the best way to live life is the vegan way with a lot of science fiction and fantasy novels. 
	Living in a cottage in the woods with a porch and a birdbath in your backyard, while watching the various species of birds flying about, as well as the raccoons that scamper across the roof at night, is the perfect way to go about this life.
