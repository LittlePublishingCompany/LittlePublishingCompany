	I know words in seven different languages! Albeit, Iâ€™m not fluent in six of them, I just know enough words to annoy anyone who speaks those languages by tricking them into thinking I do as well. Unfortunately, I have plenty of opportunities to employ this powerful vexation upon unsuspecting foes for I love to travel, encounter other cultures, and say hello like a pro. 
	The deep, underlying cause is my love for all things adventure, which has given me as many wonderful experiences as it has horrible mistakes. (Freebie: don't swim in a pond in Africa until you are sure there are no crocodiles.) Subsequently, this has caused me to know all of life as an adventure, and I continually seek ways to explore it with whomever I can. This inevitably bleeds over into my writing, which is usually inspired by my insatiable daydreaming that is so often a bane of functional living, but at least it is something you can come to enjoy.
